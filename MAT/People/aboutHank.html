<h2>Hank Bull</h2>

Hank Bull is a Canadian artist associated with the Western Front in Vancouver.
He uses a variety of media to express an interest in community, networks and
collaboration. His work is guided by a concern for spirit, nature and politics.
For him art is subject driven, about relationships, organic processes and
everyday life. It only occasionally leaves its trace in the form of a tangible
object.<p>

A son of the cloth and a product of boarding school, Bull set out for Paris in
1968, wandered the museums of Europe, played in blues bands, attended the New
School of Art in Toronto and held a variety of odd jobs (tobacco picker,
brakeman, bartender) before joining the Western Front not long after it was
founded in 1973. It was here that he met Kate Craig, Eric Metcalfe and other
artists with whom he has artists with whom he has worked closely ever since.</p><p>

Influenced by mail art, Fluxus and the emergence of new media, he began to
experiment with performance and radio. In 1976 he collaborated with Patrick
Ready in the formation of the HP Radio Show, a weekly broadcast on CFRO-FM
which explored the possibilities of radio as an art medium. With other Western
Front artists he formed Canada Shadows, touring Europe twice with shadow plays
that combined electronic music, movement, multi-lingual text, various kinds of
light, projection and screens.</p><p>

In 1980-81 he left Vancouver for an extended trip around the world with Kate
Craig, meeting artists in Asia, Africa and Europe. Since then he has been
committed to international exchange, telecommunications and video. As well as
video collaborations with Eric Metcalfe, Antoni Muntadas and others, in 1985 he
curated INFERMENTAL VI, a six-hour compendium of video from 25 countries. He
has contributed to the Venice Biennale, Dokumenta and has works in the
collections of the New York Museum of Modern Art and the Montreal Museum of
Contemporary Art. He continues to work as an administrator and curator at the
Western Front. In recent years he has organized exhibitions by William S.
Burroughs and cross-Canada tours for a number of Japanese performance artists.
He is currently involved in networked multimedia projects for the Western Front
and works in the local community to develop the relation between culture and
ecology. He spends his summers in the bush where he paints landscapes as a
hobby.</p><p>
