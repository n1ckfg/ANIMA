Modernism has many definitions. In "Modernist Painting," Clement
Greenberg finds the origin of modernism in the "immanent criticism" of Kant.
Defining modernism as "the use of the characteristic methods of a discipline to
criticize the discipline itself-not in order to subvert it, but to entrench
it more
firmly in its area of competence," he insists that "[m]odernism has never meant
anything like a break with the past. It may mean a devolution, an unravelling of
anterior tradition, but it also means its continuation... Nothing could be
further from the authentic art of our times than the idea of a rupture of
continuity."1  For Greenberg, Modernism is a diacritical practice that is
inherently progressive: it builds on the past and moves forward into the
future.</p><p>
Like modernism, postmodernism has many definitions and is applied to
diverse objects. Jean-Francois Lyotard describes the postmodern condition as a
collapse of narratives of legitimation, as "that which denies itself the
solace of
good forms, the consensus of a taste which would make it possible to share
collectively the nostalgia for the unattainable," yet remains "undoubtedly part
of the modern."2</p><p>

Susan Suleiman gives a particularly useful definition. In the introduction
to Subversive Intent  she writes: "I interpret [postmodernism] as that
moment of
extreme (perhaps tragic, perhaps playful) self-consciousness when the present
-our present-takes to reflecting on its relation to the past and to the future
primarily as a problem of repetition. How does one create a future that will
acknowledge and incorporate the past-a past that includes, in our very own
century, some of the darkest moments in human history-without repeating
it?"3</p><p>

The very name we are giving to this curious condition is indicative of its
conflicted relation to the past. If modernism is taken to represent a
history that
stretches behind us, then this new word, (formed by the attachment of a prefix
that indicates anteriority) indicates both a separation from and a
connection to
that history. The relation between modernism and post- is necessarily complex
and conflicted. If we are to think of postmodernism as a condition in which
temporality becomes a problem, in which time ceases to progress in a
predictable linear way and begins to behave in strange ways that are
difficult to
understand, then perhaps we must admit that postmodernism is both part of
and radically different from modernism.</p><p>

This apparently paradoxical situation appears again and again as
postmodern theory attempts to wrangle with given binarisms: subject/object,
space/time, ideal/material, mind/body, nature/culture, essence/context (to
name just a few). In each case, where there used to be a clear-cut
distinction we
find a collapse. Yet within the collapsed structure lies a field of
differences. Like
the first person in Mark Leyner's My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist, it is "an
infinitely hot and dense dot."4</p><p>

The historical practice of Michel Foucault exemplifies this complexity, in
that it is implicated in modernist historiography as it undermines it. In
Discipline and Punish, Foucault identifies Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon as a
metaphor for and effect of the distributions of power in eighteenth century
France. "The Panopticon... must be understood as a generalizable model of
functioning; a way of defining power relations in terms of the everyday life of
men."5</p><p>
  But it is an historically discrete level of generality. Discipline
and Punish
isn't about the present, and it would be a mistake to employ the figure of the
Panopticon to describe contemporary social space. Although contemporary life
has many features in common with that historical period Foucault calls
"classical," the strength of Foucault's re-reading of French history lies
precisely
in his refusal to fabricate trans-historical universals. In this sense, his
understanding of history stands in critical opposition to modernist notions of
history as a teleological progression toward a utopian future.</p><p>
In order to better understand this distinction, let us look briefly at two
antecedents to Foucault's historiography. In his lectures on Reason and
History,
GWF Hegel describes history as a dialectical movement toward the realization
of the "Idea," the logical power of divinity, through "Reason," as "Spirit."
"Reason is the law of the world and... therefore, in world history, things have
come about rationally. ... That this Idea  or Reason  be the True, the Eternal,
the Absolute Power and that it and nothing but it, its glory and majesty,
manifests itself in the world... has been proved in philosophy."6</p><p>
  Hegel sees
history as a worldly manifestation of philosophical absolutes. Human subjects
are thus subjects of history to the extent that they manifest a "will to
Spirit,"
and this "will to Spirit" is itself an historical inevitability. "The Spirit's
development, its progression and ascent to an ever higher concept of
itself... is
the result, on the one hand, of the inner development of the Idea and, on the
other, of the activity of individuals, who are its agents and bring about its
actualization."7</p><p>

It is interesting to read Foucault in light of Hegel's transcendent notion of
reason. Unlike Hegel, Foucault does not take the individual as a given. On the
contrary, for Foucault, the individual is not an agent of the Idea but an
"effect
of power." In his published lecture of January 7, 1976, Foucault writes: "The
individual is not to be conceived as a sort of elementary nucleus, a primitive
atom, a multiple and inert material on which power comes to fasten or against
which it happens to strike... In fact, it is already one of the prime
effects of
power that certain bodies, certain gestures, certain discourses, certain
desires,
come to be identified and constituted as individuals."8</p><p>
  It would seem that
power takes a similar in Foucault's theory that the Idea takes in Hegel's. The
operative terms (power and Idea) are both ubiquitous and pervasively causal.
Power, for Foucault, produces knowledge, histories, subjectivity much as the
Idea, for Hegel, is the driving force of philosophy, history and the
individual.</p><p>
The difference is not, as one might suspect, that Hegel's Idea is a positive
force where Foucault's power is negative. On the contrary, for Foucault power
is productive: "If power were never anything but repressive," Foucault
asks, "do
you think anyone would be brought to obey it? What makes power hold good,
what makes it accepted, is simply the fact that it doesn't only weigh on us
as a
force that says no, but that it traverses and produces things, it induces
pleasure,
forms knowledge, produces discourse."9</p><p>
  The crucial difference, if it could be
reduced to a single opposition, would be that where Hegel starts with a
universal abstraction that has been philosophically derived and proceeds to
demonstrate its relation to concrete particularities, Foucault starts with the
concrete and particular and proceeds toward abstraction. Where Hegel starts
with Reason and finds it actualized in history, Foucault starts with specific
institutions such as the prison and the clinic and derives from them
descriptions
of how power circulates in specific historical periods. Where Hegel's method
descends from the general to the specific and the ideal to the material,
Foucault
conducts "an ascending  analysis."10</p><p>
  This allows Foucault to destabilize the
abstractions that are used to deduce and thus justify given institutions as
historically inevitable. It opposes the descending logic of progress with an
adductive critique of historical eventualities. Put simply, it allows us to
see that
history proceeds not out of necessity but out of contingency, that history
is not
necessarily as it should or must be but is, rather, the product of a
complex and
indeterminate set of negotiations.</p><p>

It is here that Foucault's debt to Karl Marx becomes evident. "In direct
contrast to German philosophy which descends from heaven to earth, here we
ascend from earth to heaven."11  </p><p>
Marx rejects Hegel's idealism, and replaces it
with an empirical materialism, an understanding of history as the sum of lived
relations between and among classed subjects. Like Foucault after him, Marx
begins his analysis of history with observation of concrete phenomena and
institutions. "The premises from which we begin are... the real
individuals, their
activity and the material conditions under which they live... These
premises can
thus be verified in a purely empirical way."12  </p><p>
It is this grounding in
observation of the material world that situates Marx's political economy under
the rubric of the Enlightenment, whose principal project is described by
Horkheimer and Adorno as a replacement of religion by science as the principal
means of explaining the world. "The program of the Enlightenment was the
disenchantment of the world; the dissolution of myths and the substitution of
knowledge for fancy... On the road to modern science, men renounce any claim
to meaning."13  </p><p>
Scientific method emerged during the Enlightenment as a
process of testing hypotheses through the execution of repeatable and
verifiable
experiments. Marxist analysis, then, is a scientific project in that its
method
shares with science a grounding faith in the utility and reliability of the
empirical. But Foucault sees his project (here described as a genealogy) as a
resistance to the effects of science on knowledge: "By comparison, then,
and in contrast to the various projects which aim to inscribe knowledge in
the hierarchical order of power associated with science, a genealogy should
be seen kind of attempt to emancipate historical knowledge from that
subjection, to render
them, that is, capable of opposition and of struggle against the coercion
of a theoretical, unitary, formal and scientific discourse."14 </p><p>
Marx aspires
to science; Foucault seeks to resist it. So while Marx and Foucault share
an historical methodology that works "from the ground up," their relation
to science is distinct. A further distinction may be drawn between
Foucault's emphasis on the micropolitical, "based on a reactivation of
local knowledge"15  and Marx's interest in politics on the macroscopic
scale of class struggle.</p><p>

And where Foucault focuses relentlessly on the past and present, Marx
allows himself to imagine the future. His materialist critique of Hegel retains
the promise of an eventual utopia in the classless society: "These
conditions of
life, which different generations find in existence, decide also whether or not
the periodically recurring revolutionary convulsion will be strong enough to
overthrow the basis of the entire existing system."16  Marx seeks to emancipate
history from Hegelian idealism through a materialist empiricism. Foucault
attempts to emancipate histories from empiricism through a kind of critical
myopia.
</p><p>
Foucault's relation to Hegel on the one hand and Marx on the other is
simultaneously one of similarity and difference. Foucault does not so much
build on the work of his Germanic forebears as operate in their ruins. His
project stands not in dialectical opposition to these modernist
historiographies
but in complicit contestation. It is implicated by the modern as it resists it.
It is this complex and fraught relation to modernism that qualifies
Foucault's project as a postmodern one. Fredrick Jameson provides an account
of the postmodern that is less complicated than the one I am describing here in
terms of its relation to that which preceded it. </p><p>
In "Postmodernism and
Consumer Society," he describes postmodernism as a discrete historical epoch
that began in the United States with the post-war economic boom. For
Jameson, postmodern culture is a set of "specific reactions against the
established forms of high modernism."17</p><p>

But it is also, in Jameson's view, the "cultural logic of late capitalism," an
effect of a specific political-economic order. Postmodernism is thus "a
periodizing concept whose function is to correlate the emergence of new formal
features in culture with the emergence of a new type of social life and a new
economic order-what is often euphemistically called modernization,
postindustrial or consumer society, the society of the media or the
spectacle, or
multinational capitalism." One is reminded here of Marx's optical analogy: "If
in all ideology men and their circumstances appear upside-down as in a camera
obscura, this phenomenon arises just as much from their historical life-process
as the inversion of objects on the retina does from their physical
life-process."18</p><p>
Through this wonderful trope, ideology emerges as the topsy-turvy projection
of material history, much as culture, in Jameson's analysis, is an effect of
political economy. Though in Jameson's account the relation is, unfortunately,
more straight-forward.</p><p>

But if Jameson's analysis succumbs to a surplus of discretion in its
description of the relations between postmodern culture and modernism on the
one hand and late capitalism on the other, it manages an account of
postmodern temporality that is more sophisticated. He describes this
temporality in terms of schizophrenia.</p><p>

Jameson's deployment of schizophrenia "is meant to be descriptive and
not diagnostic."19  In Lacanian psychoanalysis, schizophrenia is a failure
on the
part of the subject to accede into language. Schizophrenia is thus a "breakdown
of the relationship between signifiers. For Lacan, the experience of
temporality... is also an effect of language. It is because language has a
past and
a future, because the sentence moves in time, that we have what seems to us a
concrete or lived experience of time. But since the schizophrenic does not know
language articulation in that way, he or she does not have our experience of
temporal continuity either, but is condemned to live a perpetual present with
which the various moments of his or her past have little connection and for
which there is no conceivable future."20  </p><p>
This account of postmodern
temporality is strikingly similar to the one that Suleiman describes. And it
resonates with the difference between a modernist historiography that
presupposes progress and a postmodernist one that refuses to imagine a strong
continuity between past, present and future.</p><p>

An effect of this schizophrenic temporality is that "the experience of the
present becomes powerfully, overwhelmingly vivid and 'material.'"21  If
postmodernism is, as Jameson suggests, an effect of post-industrial capitalism,
then Southern California is a quintessential example of postmodern social
space, since the vast majority of its urban space has been constructed since
World War II. This idea of postmodernism as an a historical condition helps to
explain the rampant commodity fetishism and obsessive concern with surfaces,
as well as the historical dislocation and lack of foresight that are
manifested in
typically Southern Californian phenomena such as auto detailing and cheap
stucco strip malls, plastic surgery and "Los Angelization."</p><p>

In a dossier on the exhibition Les Immateriaux,  Lyotard relates this idea of
postmodern time to the urban space of Southern California. "When you drive
from San Diego to Santa Barbara... you go through a zone of 'conurbation...'
The opposition between a centre and a periphery disappears, as does the
opposition between an inside (the city of men) and an outside (nature)...
This is
the kind of space-time... which has been chosen for 'the Immaterials.'"22   As
spatial oppositions collapse into each other, so does the opposition between
space and time. What emerges is a schizo-space of glowing surfaces and
accelerated movement.</p><p>

A crucial feature of this emergence is the increasing mediation of new
technologies. Technologies are not sets of material objects, but means through
which objects and discourses are produced. I am thinking here particularly of
technologies of electronic representation and communication such as television,
telephony, computing and digital imaging. These technologies are both
manifestations and producers of postmodernity. Lyotard writes: "Technology is
not the cause of the decline of the modern figure; rather, it is one of its
signs."23  Much as political-economy and cultural conditions produce
each other in a symbiotic relation,  technologies and the social field are
engaged
in a circular dynamic.</p><p>

By increasing the speed of communications, new technologies participate
in a collapse of spatial distances. As schizophrenia, the postmodern
condition is
both a problem of space-time and a crisis of subjectivity. The modern
conception of the human subject as a willful agent and unique, individual
author ceases to obtain. As Jameson writes, "the modernist aesthetic is in some
way organically linked to the conception of a unique self and private
identity...
which can be expected to generate its own unique vision of the world."24   It
becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to maintain this (illusory)
uniqueness if the face of a world that is hypersaturated with technologically
mediated representations. Postmodern subjectivity appears as a negotiation of
programmed experiences, a reinscription of persistent simulations of an ever-
more-remote "real."</p><p>

Lyotard explains the collapse of the modern subject as an uncertainty in
the relation between human agency and the world of objects, matter and mind.
"In the tradition of modernity, the relationship between human beings and
materials is fixed by the Cartesian program of mastering and possessing
nature."25  As another implosion of binary oppositions into uncertainty, this
collapse is a familiar trope of the postmodern. Lyotard links the "death of the
subject" directly to these new technologies: "Man's anxiety is that he is
losing
his (so-called) identity as a 'human being.' One aspect of 'immaterials...'
is that
they imply just such a loss of identity... Most of these 'immaterials' are
generated from computer end electronics technosciences..."26   In the so-called
"immaterials" the distinction between medium and message cannot be
maintained. The binary codes of computer software and electromagnetic waves of
radio and television broadcasts are immaterializations of both signifier and
signified at the same time. They stand as instances of the poststructural, non-
binary sign. They frustrate a program of modern agency in which the subject
exerts her or his will on the object in a transformative project of production.
The immaterials resist objectification because they are always already in play.
In his examination of French history, Foucault sees the Panopticon as a
technology of power. "In Discipline and Punish  what I wanted to show was
how... there was a veritable technological take-off in the productivity of
power."27  As we seek to describe postmodernism as a productive effect of a
specific historical moment, then, we might look at the model of the net as a
paradigm for the contemporary distribution of power. The net describes a
network of linked communications networks, a computerized fabric of
information.</p><p>

As more and more significant interactions take place on the net, it
becomes increasingly important to situate it historically. I am suggesting that
the net is to postmodern relations in the West what the Panopticon is to
"classical" relations of power in France. In a discussion of contemporary power
relations, Foucault himself writes: "power establishes a network through which
it freely circulates."28  In the Panoptic regime, power is concentrated in
a centre
that exerts control over the periphery through an apparatus of visibility.</p><p>
Those on the periphery internalize the controlling effects of the gaze, policing
their own behaviours and desires. With the net, power is no longer centralized: it
offers a structure without a centre and periphery. Like the "conurban"
topography of Southern California, it consists of a dispersed array of
nodes that
are connected by a vascular system of arteries and capillaries of
communication.
Power is not exerted and internalized through a visual economy; it is already
diffused, and reproduces itself constantly and incessantly as each node
interacts
on the network in a multiplicitous economy of visual, textual and auditory
signs . Information on the net is encoded, compressed and encrypted through
the digital technology of binary code. All information on the net is always
reduced to a stream of ones and zeros. In the Panopticon, both the
macrostructure and the microstructure are binary. Center is paired and opposed
to periphery; gaze is a relation of seer to seen. The net, on the other
hand, has a
non-binary macrostructure, but its microstructure is, ultimately, binary code
itself. I take this as yet another example of the nets paradigmatic stature
within
postmodernism, since at the level of its basic structures, it is at once
plural and
binary, simultaneously one thing and the other.</p><p>

The net is a space of instantaneous and interactive communication. In his
discussion of an earlier phase in the development of communication
technologies, Walter Benjamin describes the effects of the reduction of the
distance between representations and the objects they refer to. "That which
withers in the age of mechanical reproduction," he writes, "is the aura."29  In
the postmodern age of electronic communication, the aura has collapsed
entirely. Where the delay between the production and reception of visual and
textual signs moved from slow to fast in the industrial age, the lag can now be
measured only in nanoseconds. And where production and reception were once
distinct and qualitatively removed from each other, they now merge into a
complex textual practice. Reading becomes a form of writing, and vice versa.
Messages float freely, disassociated from their producers. As a result, textual
producers on the net can no longer be seen as authors in the modernist sense.
With electronic mail, for example, messages are easily modified and forwarded,
but the changes and the 'original' source or, more precisely, starting point,
cannot be determined. The Barthesian move from work to text transpires in a
burst of electromagnetic impulses.30  In "chat" spaces where real-time
conversations take place through a textual interface, distinctions between
speech
and writing begin to dissolve. What emerges with the net is an environment
that can be described more readily as a mode of intertexuality than in terms of
embodied subjects in space.</p><p>

The net enacts and is reproduced in the disembodiment of the human
subject. Participants interact as discursive entities whose physiological
properties cannot be deduced by the messages they send and receive. Identity is
no longer determined by a body whose gender is fixed in a male/female logic of
genital configuration. The performative qualities of identity are foregrounded
to the extent that it can no longer be seen as a fixed and persistent set of
qualities, and becomes eminently contingent and continually reproduced in
specific discursive contexts.</p><p>

The net, then, is a post-human environment where communities are
established not by spatial proximity but through discursive affinities. In
the net,
post-human subjects group themselves and are grouped by shared interests and
communication styles.</p><p>

I have described postmodernism as an implosion of binary relations into a
dense and uncertain field of shifting differences. This collapse is
reproduced as a
crisis of subjectivity and a problem of time. Much of the popular discussion of
the new technologies of electronic communication is focused on the future.
What impact will they have on our cultures and institutions? How will they
change us? It seems that the idea of the future is once again encroaching
on the
the present. But this imagination of the future isn't tantamount to a
recapitulation of modernist progress. It is almost as if the future has
ceased to
recede into posteriority, and has begun to arrive in the present. Does this
nascent ability to imagine a future in the present tense indicate that we are
emerging into a new paradigm whose name will not include in its body the
word "modern?" It is impossible to know.</p><p>
