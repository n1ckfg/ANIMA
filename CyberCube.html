<p>
</p><h3>The Development of a Prototype Three Dimensional Interface using a 
Cybernetic Process Language and Virtual Operating Environment for 
Mapping Complex Interactive Multimedia Information Environments 
and Navigating Immersive Networked Communications Space </h3>
<p>

The intent of the CyberCube Project is to develop prototypes of an interface for
an operating environment and new communications system for shared information
space created by computer-mediated networks. The system is a networked
hypermedia interface useful in mapping and navigating in a complex immersive
information universe. </p><p>

The project is intended to develop a process-based language for
interactive communications specific to networked information environments. The
objective is the development of a system for the three-dimensional
representation and manipulation of symbolic knowledge in large networked
hypermedia information databases. The project methodology is to design and
implement a prototype interface, process language, and operating environment as
the fundamental building blocks for cyberspace. </p><p>

The CyberCube is a software application and interface that provides an 
efficient way of accessing and organizing large amounts of time based 
multimedia information within three-dimensional space. 
It is based on the metaphor of a three-dimensional
spatial grid for the mapping, navigation, organization and retrieval of
information. </p><p>

The interface in appearance looks like a three-dimensional cube, it
sides are made up of grids of squares. It is akin to a spreadsheet of symbols,
but unlike a spreadsheet it is not made of numbers in cells, but is actually a
matrix of containers for symbols. It acts like a multidimensional, multimedia
spreadsheet for dynamically related cybernetic symbols. </p><p>

The operating
environment itself is a network of symbols, or a nebulae of signifieds based on
a multiplicity of codes in a plurally structured multiverse of meaning. The
assumption is that language constituted in it's current form as static text
creates tremendous navigational problems and is inefficient and ultimately
unsuitable for developing modes of thought and expression in virtual worlds. In
complex multidimensional communications space cybernetic or process based
language becomes a necessity. </p><p>

Such a language could be constituted of
CyberSymbols which can be made of any combination of digital media. CyberSymbols
are dynamically interrelated highly condensed and evolving symbolic
representations. The symbols can represent data or concepts on a variety of
levels; these may be categorized as pictographic, ideographic, alphabetic, or
videographic.</p><p>

 Various experimental development strategies are being undertaken.
For example, the research team is using a participatory design approach called
the MediaGame, which is based on play theory and transformational game
strategies, where an experimental network development community is being
developed. </p><p>

Over a multimedia network the CyberCube is used as an infrastructure
to discuss, develop and test ideas, prototypes and consensual design metaphors
for the development of the interface and cybernetic language for shared
communications space. </p><p>

The system is designed to be scalable and portable between
different media, networks, technology and platforms, it could work in screen,
hand-held, projected and immersive environments.</p><p>

 There are a variety of social,
commercial and cultural applications for the system. It can be used as a
production tool for the creation of stand-alone interactive hypermedia
productions and artworks; a telecommunications interface for multimedia
conferencing and personal messaging systems; an interface for visualisation,
navigation and retrieval in large multimedia databases; and for developing
networked and collaborative virtual environments for work, play, education,
creativity and communications.</p><p>
