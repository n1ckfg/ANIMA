<h2>"<a href="war.html">Power</a> is the first principle of human cultural evolution." </h2>
Charles Needham

<pre>"While it was the doubling of brain size that accounted for the 
speciation of Homo Habilis into Homo Erectus, it was the doubling of 
brain function, ie. the radicalization of deduplication of cerebral 
operations that accounted for the emergence and elaboration of verbal 
speech, and the speciation of Homo Erectus into Homo Sapiens.  
The rudiments of cerebral dominance, the laterilized asymmetry of 
hemispheric function, required radical, dialectic type differentation 
before syntax, semantics and speech could be.  The physical, social and 
protocultural environment requirments imposed on evolving human gene pools 
provoked the necessary speciations that granted survival. "

"Explicit operations are more subject to hemispheric independence 
(cerebral segragation) , while implicit operations involve a greater 
measure of hemispheric interdependence. (cerebral integration)."

The unavoidable balancing act and stochastic process that combine to produce 
a teleological ecology of variety and stability in the natural world is also 
seen in the human.

"The specter of species-suicide, impossible without the cultural invention 
of the modern state, speaks loudly for a dramatic qualitive difference between 
the biological evolution of animal nervous systems and the long-term 
inclusion of <a href="screamandshout.html">unnatural cultural elements</a> into the biological fabric of 
the evolution of human brains."   

The right brain is colonized by the left brain
which is colonized by language
which is colonized by society
which maintains the status quo.

<strong>"...<a href="connectionists.html">cultural adaptations</a>, like all adaptations can and perhaps usually 
eventually do, <a href="technicalimperative.html">become maladaptive</a>,
diminishing rather than enhancing the survival chances of organisms bearing them."</strong>

Socialization intrinsically interpenetrates language.  
Language is the dominant mode of ideological continuance.  
The manipulation of language, the vieling of language, the ownership of 
language.  Society soft wires its pathological 'stability' into each individual.

"Like all images, the self image is mainipulated by language to the extent 
that its features are verbally and gesturaly communicable.  
The sociological-political function of cerebral dominance manipulates 
one's body-image and one's social image the personality, in concert with 
reflections from significant others in the ongoing creations of personal 
identity." Needham. P. 126
