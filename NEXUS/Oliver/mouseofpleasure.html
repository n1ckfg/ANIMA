<h2>An Eternalist</h2>
I have been an eternalist for many, many years, so many in fact that I have forgotten 
the number. 
<p>My memory has reached such a state of corruption pierced and violated by an excessive 
history that each day seems a spontaneous miraculous occasion.  I have now noticed my complete 
similarity with every other, as each day is a fellow of an infinite number of other days.  
I mean to say that I am no one and I am every one.  
I know the complete opacity of my singularity and I know the
disappearance of every other self.</p><p>

A suicide of dawn has gained a wide ascendary.  Kroker was right.  An exterminating nihilism
painted in utopianistic rainbows of essential technological toxicity is the weltanschauung of 
our era. What could one expect? When the human has abdicated to its own machinery, when code
becomes more important than meaning, when all place is same place?</p><p>

A nodding acquaintance with death exists in these somnambulists that surround me and that are me. 
There is the occasional acknowledgment, vague prescience of moments in a dream time that neither
has any control over.   This is the primary tyranny, the one that cannot be finished with, the 
one that we hear most clearly in the language of pain and the blunt cry of infants.
