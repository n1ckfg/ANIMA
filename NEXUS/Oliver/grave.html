<h2>A Gravity Of The Most Grave Sort</h2>
In the middle ages, people use to make the sign of the Cross before counting 1, 2, 3, etc.  
because they feared some <a href="progress.html">Diabolic Automatism</a> might force them to continue to count forever. 
<p>The post-industrial, post-individual must fight to become more than simply an impulse within the 
vibrating lattice of digital/corporate interconnectivity. More than an oscillation of passing 
employment within the web of informatics.  
</p><p>We may soon have no boundaries in our technical capacity to communicate with one another
yet we are still far from an ability to have no boundaries in our compassion for each other, 
or in our application of the Just.
