<h2>Brilliant Innovation Taken For Granted</h2>

"The solutions of problems are not "invented" or "deduced" they are "found"; 
they "occur".  Because <i>post factum</i> the previously separate mental fields merge 
into one and the jagged bisociative act is smoothed out into a now continuous 
associative flow, all revolutionary innovations appear after a while as trivial
and obvious, and we marvel less at the discovery itsef, than at the apparently 
abysmal stupidity of the mental stage preceding it..."
<i>
</i><p><i>Arthur Koestler, "Insight and Outlook", New York: Macmillan, 1949.</i>

</p><h2>There Are Revolutions</h2>
"A new science arises out of one that has reached a dead end.
Often <a href="chiapas.html">a revolution</a> has an interdisciplinary character-its central
discoveries often come from people straying outside the normal bounds of 
their specialties.  The problems that obsess these theorists are not 
recognized as legitimate lines of inquiry." <p>
<i>James Glick, "Chaos", Penguin, 1987.</i>
