<h2>No Boundaries</h2>
"There is no boundaries in things.  Laws try to impose some, 
and the mind cannot bear it."- Pascal, Mathematician and philosopher (b.1623-d.1662)
<p>In the <a href="innovation.html">intercourse</a> between <a href="Syntacticaltools.html">applied aesthetics</a> 
and a thorough admittance of the <a href="yeshello-1.html">mnemonic</a> and morphic essentialism of digital tools,
exists <a href="Idealworldfire.html">the Ideal</a>.</p><p>Though the Ideal is <a href="screamandshout.html">not necessarily 
conducive to the human</a>
it is 
the predicted realm of our intentionality.  It is the Platonic model upon which 
lower forms come into existence in envious simulation. 
It is the state of the non-dead, the non-human, the faultless and 
stringently abstract.</p><p>Constantly entertained and illuminated by its own brilliance, it 
is the hallucinated inscriptions of our wish.  So linked <a href="repetition.html">to desire</a>, 
it is Janus like, Eros and 
Thanatos combined in a rhythm of vain artificiality that defines an always coming into being.  As such it is monstrous in its adaptability, its aptitude to transmigrate, to 
transform itself into something else.  A something else that is yet, only a facet of 
its basic impossibility - stainless, uncorrupted, ageless, without substance.
</p><h2>Hermeneutical Bits</h2>
"Multiplicity<a href="mediabasediscussiondoc.#associative" class="broken"></a> which is not reduced to unity is confusion.  
Unity which does not depend on multiplicity is tyranny."- Pascal
<p>Hysterically definitive, thoroughly logical, repeated chants of Zeros' 
and Ones' gives you any number of numbers to a practical infinity of 
mathematically seasonable strawberry fields. The binary diffuses an 
exactitude of similitude, rains an illusion of perfectitude through 
continual electronic switches allowing and disallowing, in algorithmic 
procedural commands.  
</p><h2>There Is No God But God</h2>
<a href="limit.html">So, what does this reflect</a> but the successes of an inhuman patience, 
an Alhabraic monotony of <a name="one.html#complex">labyrinthine design</a>.  Moslem culture with its violence 
against representations and appreciation of <a href="wish.html">repetitive</a> abstraction finds a home in your 
hard drive.   There is no God but God.<p><a href="War.html#Virilio%20is%20correct">Terminal language.</a> </p><p>Program Language. 
</p><p>The adjustable face of grammar, the originating  of human 
intelligence replaced by the nervous excitation of an expecting,
silicon mask.  An immaculate mask of distinct memory, but no resemblances.  
</p><h3>Und So Weiter Or And So On</h3>
To be like the capacity of each wave of the ocean remembering every other wave 
of the ocean that has ever been.<p>
The essential fluidity of digital discourse insists upon a massive turning of attention
upon the tongue, the language, the intercourse, between programs.
</p><p>What program are you 
watching? What program is watching you? What program are you acting in?
</p><p>In the theoretical asanas of structuralism, deconstruction, and in 
information theory, where analysis is reflexive, where meta codes configure the
plastic operants of creativity, the hands of differance meet, tied and bound to 
a new and improved uncertainty.
</p><p>These contents, the complexities of tomorrow, the magic and fantasy of the impossible made 
possible, have not come yet, other than in fragments, at best in installments of a 
more integrative existence and pushed up against the wall, we are violated by a promise of our  own making. 
All heavens, all arabian nights, all mirror palaces, and bright blue flowers, 
ice crystal castles and luminous landscapes and mythical animals who lay down with 
one another in peace and harmony. 


</p><p>The promise of the perfect thursts a  hollow shaft of impregnable 
light  and in whispered seductive technological jargon, camouflages  its hostile, virulent virus.
   
</p><h2>Or <a href="fantasticutopiansex.html">The Art Of Entering Anothers Body</a></h2>
Telecommunication will become the primary heuristic information 
sphere, source, re-source, gallery/studio of <a href="mediabasediscussiondoc.html">new media</a> art and art inter-activity  of 
the postmodern multicultural social.<p>Interpenetrating hard core experimentalism in 
informatics/<a href="mediabasediscussiondoc.html#hypermedia">hypermedia</a>/telecommunications depends 
upon a reliance on the formal qualities of the coding and interface design. 
It is through the reflections engendered by an immersion in the property of encoding, 
and of memory, that the structure of future developments rests. </p><h2>Memory Theatre</h2>
Mutual illumination, parallelisms, perpetual syncronicity.  Everything has a meaning.
<p>And you'd better listen up! (One of the greatest somnabulists, the prophetess of Prevost, 
said in pronouncements edited by Justinus Kerner in the early part of the
nineteenth century, "The world is a circle for me.  In this circle
I could go forwards and backwards and see what there had been and what was to come.") 
</p><p>To predict and predicate the emerging paradoxical function of global 
telecommunications as transient loci and central medium of cultural advocacy, 
exchange, and change we need to create an experimental station.  It needs to be
a  rapaciously interdisciplinary critical area for the 
application of the association of informational design and communications.   
</p><p><a href="Iamdreaming.html">This gate way</a> is to embody a futuristic reading of implications and scenarios of the digital 
realm for the creation 
of art and the dissemination of the cultural . 
  
</p><h3>Everywhere and Nowhere</h3>
The Idea's radiation <a href="mouseofpleasure.html">in the finite</a> through the online. 
<p>To translate from the gestures of the user, commands, to the cup runneth over of the 
informational epiphany is the desired art.
 </p><p>What is it that you want to know when everything known is waiting to be downloaded? 
How will you speak to a cacophony?
</p><h2>Even Among Dragons There Are Nine Varieties</h2>
(Han Chinese folk expression)  
<p>No matter -- even bottled in its binary transforms, change is always, and only, a 
recognition of difference.  This, the attributes of every system or program is, ultimately, 
the translations of metaphors inscribed from our own minds likeness.  They are the 
graven images of our ideologies, they are the icons of our Gods, they are the banalities of our 
realities, and they are the unknowns of our fears and ecstasies.  
</p><p>However the specialization required to maintain position within 
the current competitive/slave environment posits a narrowing of horizons. A
greater and greater dependence upon instrumental reason creates <a href="definitelytime.html">an elite</a> that is irresponsible
to the idea of a common culture.The overriding tendency is loss. Loss of cultural value 
and of value itself.  
For when everything has become a measure of something else, whether it be 
information or economic exchange, the remembrances of the individual, the basis of 
their sympathetic relation with the world, is forgotten, disallowed.  
The result in art and culture is the turning of the linearity of quest and 
the articulation of meaning into the uroboros of solipsism, pastiche, and appropriations,
 -<a href="War.html#culture"> history is liquefied</a>, but there is really nothing left to drink.
</p><h2>Dogs Are To Humans</h2>
"The elite who occupy the commanding heights of digital reality are suicidal nihilists. 
Suicidal nihilists know that there is no longer any substantive purpose to their willing.  But they would 
always prefer to go on willing than not to act at all.  They can very happily ally themselves with a 
notion of nuclear holocaust or perfect exterminism....They're creating again and again the 
exterminism of human memory, the exterminism of human sensibility, the exterminism of individuated 
human intelligence, <a href="grave.html">the exterminism of human morality </a>itself." 
 - Arthur Kroker in Mondo 2000, Issue #11. 1994
<p>Claude Shannon, widely recognized as one of the 
principal architects of modern electronic communications, sees "no limits to the capacities of 
thinking machines," and "can visualize 
a time in the future when we persons will be to computers <a href="screamandshout.html">as dogs are to humans</a>".
</p><p>When information ceases its active role and when its coherence breaks down, the organism enters 
into a state of decay and breaks up into a mere collection of inanimate components.  Please extrapolate
from the above...</p><p></p><h1><tt>The active role of communication is the connectivity and unison of the 
community of communities...the prerogative of cultural production. </tt></h1>
<h2>But Still The Problem of Souls</h2>
<a href="repetition.html">Meaning goes back to a root that signifies 'opinio' or 'intention' and is closely related to 
the word moaning.</a>
<p>An endless system of deferrals transpires between these social and individual meanings 
and the imposing reality of 
biological wants that they of necessity hinge upon, within the psychological, evolutionary, yet 
ephemeral self .  It is here where <a href="splitbrain.html">power</a> and politics, evoked by will,  becomes the primary 
determinate, over and above the nicety of a usefully applied conceptual.</p><p>Politics, to quote 
the Canadian Revolutionary William Lyon Mackenzie, "is the science that teaches the people 
of a country to care for each other." (1836)
