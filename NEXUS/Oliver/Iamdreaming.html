- Elaud
</p><p>The way that can be spoken of is not the constant way; the name that can be named 
is not the constant name. The nameless was the begining of heaven and earth; the named 
was the mother of the myriad creatures.  Hence always rid yourself of desires in order 
to observe its secrets; but always allow yourself to have desires in order to observe its 
manifestation.  These two are the same  but diverge in name as they issue forth.  
Being the same they are called mysteries.  Mystery upon mystery the gateway of the 
manifold secrets. - Tao Te Ching
