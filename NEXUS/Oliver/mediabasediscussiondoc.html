<h1>Mediabase</h1>
Jeff Berryman/Oliver Hockenhull<p>
</p><pre>This is a discussion document that offers a new research focus for 
CISR's collaborative multimedia program.  This theme is relevant to the post 
production editing of multimedia and traditional video/film, and to more general 
questions of multimedia interactivity.  

This paper also intends on explicating some of the formal properties of the new 
mediums and suggests the application of this understanding through novel software 
design principles.

The basic idea is to apply database technology to the creation and
structuring of media art works.  The hypotheses are that media art works 
can be usefully represented as databases, that such databases ("mediabases") 
can be used as practical tools to support shared invention, production, and 
delivery of both interactive and linear media works, and that database science 
allows for a new class of forms for interactive work. 
<h2>Code, Structure, Script</h2>
A mediabase is a computer database whose purpose is to store a media work or 
information pertaining to the structure and creation of a media work.  
The mediabase will give access to the formal characteristics of a new 
media work and may blend production content, script, and, in some cases, 
production data.  

In an interactive work a viewer's interventions would be implemented 
as database retrieval operations, and the presented images and sounds 
would be data extracted from the mediabase.  

For a traditional work (film or video) edited in a non-linear editing 
suite,  the mediabase would, allow for editors to automate some of the 
task presently processed through the labours of editing decision lists.

A number of current interactive media works, notably nonfiction works that 
deal with archives, are concerned with presenting contents of informational 
databases.  Such databases, which we call domain databases, are not complete 
mediabases in the sense that we are using the term here, because they 
contain the content of the work (or part of it), but not any script, production, 
or presentation data.  

Every media work involves script, production, presentation, and content data.  
In current practice, this data is recorded in various ad-hoc ways.  Under the 
mediabase concept, this data is organised and integrated in machine-readable 
form, in a way that allows the use of contemporary database tools.  
The extent to which the data can be captured in this way and the extent to 
which it must be transformed to be integrated effectively are research issues.
<h2>Research Opportunities</h2>
Taking the database approach to media works might lead us down a 
number of research avenues:  
<h3>Collaborative Work</h3>
Mediabases would be good for supporting collaborative work, in that a 
mediabase can have specific elements that are created, maintained, and 
shared in organized ways by the various individuals and teams involved 
with the creation process.  

Research in this area would entail analysis of media works creation processes, 
and design of appropriate database structures to support the required collaborative 
relationships.  An important challenge would be to develop common concepts for 
minimizing the number of different database designs needed to support the 
various media and styles in current practice.

Database technology is presently highly evolved in the areas of data 
sharing and distributed access.  This represents a great potential 
advantage, one which could help this project produce usable early results.
<a href="syntacticaltools.html"><h3>Navigation</h3></a>
Mediabases are not intended to be only administrative tools for organizing 
production teams.  The intent is to develop data design and programming principles 
that render mediabase systems capable of implementing aesthetic principles in 
media works.  

One project in the aesthetic area would apply database techniques to the problem of 
selecting paths through navigable works.  At present, such paths usually must be 
completely preprogrammed.  As the complexity of interactive genres increases, this 
will become less and less feasible.  Where discrete works or fragments are merged, 
preprogrammed navigation may be completely impossible without re-doing 
whole productions. Also, preprogramming may in some cases  be aesthetically 
undesirable.  In general, there is a need for computer assistance 
in the making of navigation decisions.

If we think of a linear work as a particular traversal of a navigable one, it 
becomes evident that navigating and editing have much in common.  

Montage theory describes the meanings of cinematic transitions (editing) in 
terms of the attributes of the shots and scenes involved.  

This project would seek to apply montage theory to the navigation problem, 
using a database implementation approach.  The research would first devise 
a methodology for representing shot and scene attributes in relational database 
form, then develop software to use those attributes for helping make navigation 
decisions in interactive works.  This software would present to the user, at each 
interactive decision point, those navigation alternatives that would tend to have 
the most cinematic meaning.  

Thus, the interactive work would tend to foster valid viewer experiences, 
regardless of how much preprogramming had been done or not done.

In the project plan we wish to develop several stages of montage software 
development, beginning with simple algorithmic code, and ending with 
mixed-initiative expert systems.

This project concept is based principally on the ideas of Oliver Hockenhull, 
a Vancouver filmmaker, writer and communition theorist, who has for 
several years been working on the concept of applying montage theory to 
interactive works.

<h2>The Associative Work &amp; Self-Contextualization</h2>
<a name="hypermedia">Most of today's interactive media work is based on the 
hypermedia concept, in which data elements can contain one or more pointers that
viewers can follow to reach other such elements.  Thus, a hypermedia document is a 
network, in which data elements form a multiply connected nonhierarchical graph.</a>

Navigation, the process of following pointers from <a href="ontotheground.html">one 
data element to another</a>, is a concept akin to hunting, in which the viewer 
"goes" from one place to another, seeking an objective.

In order to produce a hypermedia work capable of delivering a rich viewer experience, 
its creators must develop and present a large and complex context -- a cyberspace...
Generally speaking, creating cyberspaces is time consuming and expensive.

The hypermedia model does not easily support works based on gathering, rather than 
hunting, paradigms.  In such works, the counterpart of navigation is associatioon, 
in which elements are gathered from global contexts and arranged to form local contexts.

<a name="mediabasediscussiondoc.html#associative">Associative works</a> are works that 
offer the viewer the ability to gather elements from a global context and arrange 
them into one or more private contexts.  
Association is a relational activity, in which the viewer builds 
contexts through interaction with the work.

We call an associative work self-contextualizing to suggest that each viewer's 
particular context is created afresh from the elements of the work, without 
starting from a prebuilt global form.  

We envision the primary elements of an associative work as follows:
	<p>1.	One or more search spaces, which are databases from which the viewer may 
	extract elements of content.  The union of all a work�s search spaces is referred 
	to as its global context.  Many, if not most, works will have only a single search 
	space in their global contexts.
	</p><p>2.	One or more gathering tools that the viewer can use to find elements in the 
	global context.  These tools may be common to all search spaces, or specific to 
	particular ones.
	</p><p>3.	One or more personal workspaces for each viewer.  For many works, 
	these workspaces would be non-volatile, to allow continuity over multiple 
	sessions.  The structure of the workspaces would vary from work to work, and 
	could vary from simple to complex.
	</p><p>4.	One or more arranging tools that the viewer can use to arrange gathered 
	elements in the workspaces.

It is natural to envision the user interface to such a work as one that would 
allow many different objects -- images, animations, sounds, and so on -- to coexist 
in a single multimedia presentation at once.  Which elements were combined and 
juxtaposed would vary, depending on the what objects the viewer had gathered and 
how she or he had arranged them in the personal workspace.    
</p><h3>Searches, Continuity, and Style</h3>
In most associative works, how searches work will be the strongest single 
determinant of viewer experience.  We believe that most associative works 
will support mixed-initiative searching, i.e. a searching in which gathering 
choices are made jointly by the viewer and by the work itself. 

One class of mixed-initiative systems features searches that depend on the contents 
and arrangement of the viewer's current personal context.  For example, the montage 
approach described above provides a way for searches to be qualified by cinematic 
attributes, these choice of an attribute is selected by the viewer.  Specifically, 
the searches in a montage-based associative work are constrained to find only 
(or mainly) those elements that are cinematically meaningful in the current 
personal context.  
  
In a mixed-initiative associative system, as a viewer built up her or his own 
workspace, successive searches would tend increasingly to find objects that "worked"
in it, contextually.  Thus, the system could support continuity  and style.  

The system would learn the viewer.
<h3>Publication and Combination</h3>
<a href="reddust.html">An attractive outcome</a> of the gathering process in 
associative works is that the personal workspaces created by the viewers (or, if you 
will, co-created by the viewers and the original authors) are themselves 
valid artifacts that may be preserved and shared as searchable contexts.  

We say that a personal workspace offered to others as a searchable context 
has been published.

Given certain standards, search spaces that had never "met" each other 
before could be combined to create new possibilities.  For example, CISR 
could concatenate an associative Cunningham Archive search space with search 
spaces from other artists' archives of the same historical period to allow 
viewers to find new associations.

Current database technology is moving toward an object-oriented paradigm, 
in which data elements and the programs that use them are bundled into relatively 
self-contained units  ("objects").  Because they are self-contained, these units 
tend to be more easily shared between contexts, and transported into new ones.  
Thus, having object-oriented mediabases would facilitate the reuse of published 
media material, the combining of disparate media works, and other interesting 
integrations.  

Making sharing and reuse of work easier has its risks, in that 
intellectual property and integrity of creative results can be more easily 
compromised.  This risk would be offset somewhat by the fact that modern database 
tools have highly developed access control facilities which, if properly invoked, 
can provide highly selective and secure restrictions.
<h3>Project Scope</h3>
This R&amp;D project extends from cinematic theory to database theory, with the 
results having immediate practical application.  The results would depend 
critically on effective interweaving of technical and aesthetic disciplines.  
A number of outcomes might be supported:  Various commercial and/or prototypical 
production tools could be developed to serve the different interests mentioned 
in Opportunity, above.  Sponsorship of exploratory and/or demonstration art works and 
the development of a montage software package would be a clear option. 

To do the subject justice, collaboration with Banff and other sites inside and 
outside Rapport would be indicated.  Finally, the idea would seem to offer 
good potential for academic research at the graduate and possibly faculty level.
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
It is fruitful to consider the digitalization of media creations 
(film, video, or interactive multimedia) as a distributed database 
problem in which the work is realised as a single shared database ("Mediabase") 
that is designed, built, and used in various ways by the creative team.  

For interactive works, the database and associated programming codes would also 
be the work's final form.  For conventional linear works, the final assembly 
process would be a specifically formatted extract of the database.

This approach is distinct from merely using a multimedia user interface as a 
way to access an informational database in which the information in the database 
is viewed as domain data.  

<i><strong>Understanding the relationship of aesthetic intent, software structure, 
and user interaction is a necessary departure for furthering 
eloquence in the new media.
