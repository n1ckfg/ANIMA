<h2>Progress</h2>
A Klee painting named "Angelus Novus" shows an angel looking as though he is about to 
move away from something he is fixedly contemplating.  His eyes are staring, his mouth 
is open, his wings are spread.  This is how one pictures the angel of history.  
His face is turned toward the past.  Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees 
one single <a href="technicalimperative.html">catastrophe</a> which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of 
his feet.  The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed.  
But a storm is blowing from paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the 
angel can no longer close them.  This storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his 
back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward.  This storm is what we call 
<a href="ontotheground.html">progress</a>."
- Walter Benjamin.
