<h2>Wetware Aware</h2>
"Aware of the limitations of Von Neumann architecture, cognitive scientists 
are developing computer architecture featuring large numbers of parallel 
processing units in the effort to approximate the organization and function 
of the "wet machine".  In a world in which events do not take place in a 
conveniently serial fashion, the human brain is adept at dealing with a 
vast number of separate objects and processes in parallel.  Pioneers in 
parallel processing who to refer to themselves as "connectionists", are 
rapidly developing computer systems designed to solve problems that are 
irregular, unpredictable, and governed by rules that are not universal.  
Inspired by the brain's neural network, the connectionists emphasize massive 
parallelism, distributed information storage, and associative interconnections.
(At least fifty major research efforts in this country (the U.S.) alone 
are dedicated to building new parallel computer systems...")
