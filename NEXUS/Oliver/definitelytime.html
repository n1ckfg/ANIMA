<h2>Hypocrites</h2>

<pre>As we become more and more determined to be irresponsible to the 
communities interest we will experience more and more profoundly the 
disintegration of the community.  

The propaganda of the State complaining that it must devolve from its 
responsibilities for lack of resources is an obvious falsehood.  The wealth of the 
community is simply being channeled into the hands of <a href="chiapas.html">already wealthy 
individuals, corporations, and corrupt institutions.  </a>

A financial aristocracy rules the country.  Individuals like Conrad Black.  
Born with the silver spoon, yet acting as if a self-made man, perpetuating 
the myth of the democratic nature of pure capitalism.    
 
20% of Canada's population owns 70% of the wealth of the country.   
The poor (almost all the artists of course) that's 20% of the population, 
owns -0.3 % of the wealth.  That's minus 0 point 3 per cent of the wealth. 
The struggling poor (the next 20%) owns about 2.4% of the wealth.  
The lower and upper middle class owns about 30% (Statscan.) 
<p>"You saw what's common, that which happens all the time.
But we are asking for:
That which is not alien, find it strange!
That which is common, find it inexplicable!
What is usual should amaze you.
What is the rule recognize as misuse
And where you find misuse
Take remedial measures!" 
<i>Brecht, The Exception and the Rule </i>

So, by the by, what are you, you, the well-paid middle managers, 
tenured academics, and well off intellectual worker going to do about 
this obvious disparity ?  (Not to mention the needs that must be addressed 
of the exploited elsewhere in the world?)

It is definitely time to put your money where your mouth, 
- or at least where your mouth use to be.  It's time you came up with strategies 
to spread the wealth around...job sharing would be in order for 
example, as would early 'retirement'.
