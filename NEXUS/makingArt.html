MAKING ART ONLINE is an ongoing database of artists' words about using data 
transmission systems. Statements conveying information and ideas about making 
art online are "keyed" by subject and entered into a database. Using that 
database, I periodically generate MAKING ART ONLINE, a collaboratively written 
paper. </p><p>

I see telecommunications for artists as primarily a political tool. In a 
cultural climate that assigns increasingly lower value to free excodession 
in the arts, it is vital that artists everywhere use these efficient 
communication tools to inform and alert each other so that they may combine 
in solidarity to reverse this alarming trend. </p><p>

I have been on line since 1986. I've used email to discuss projects with 
other artist's in far away places. This has enabled me to work with people 
that I other wise could not have collaborated with. Many of my projects would 
have been impossible to do without email. </p><p>

Because I am a writer, I used to spend my days alone in my room with my 
typewriter, my words, and my thoughts. On occasion, I ventured outside to 
interview people or to find information. After work, I would reenter the 
human community, via my neighborhood, my family, my circle of personal and 
professional acquaintances. But I was isolated and lonely during the working 
day, and my work did not provide any opportunity to expand my circle of 
friends and colleagues. For the past two years, however, I have participated 
in a wide-ranging, intellectually stimulating, professionally rewarding, and 
often intensely emotional exchange with dozens of new friends and hundreds of 
colleagues. And I still spend my days in a room, physically isolated. My mind, 
however, is linked with a worldwide collection of like-minded (and not so 
like-minded) souls: My virtual community. If you get a computer and a modem,

<b>THE ELECTRONIC CAFE</b></p><p>
THE CHALLENGE: We Must Create at the Same Scale as We can Destroy </p><p>
If the arts are to take a role in shaping and humanizing emerging 
technological environments, individuals and arts constituencies must begin to 
imagine at a much larger scale of creativity. </p><p>
We must begin to create at the same scale as we can destroy, or else art, and
 more dangerously the human spirit and imagination, will be rendered 
decorative and impotent.</p><p>
If the boundaries between art and life dissolve it will be the result of 
artists migrating towards a new order of artmaking, abandoning the 
conventional standards and practices and becoming 'new practitioners' or 
systems integrator, who practice situations, contexts, and permanent 
environments or utilities. The 'new practitioners' can begin the process of 
healing the aesthetic wound that has disfigured the business of Art, and 
continue the aesthetic quest in more relevant directions.</p><p> 
New creative activities must emerge such as multi-media creative solutions 
networks, not simply computer networks for Artists, but rather multi-media 
telecommunications networks with agendas that can engage multi-disciplinary 
constituencies. This will require the development of new skills and the 
cultivation of new relationships between the participants. The movement is 
towards the control of a meaningful context, creating environments not just 
to support art, but that create the possibility for new scales of creativity 
across all disciplines and boundaries.</p><p>
The dark side of the "new world information order" suggests that a new scale 
aesthetics be created. It will take several years from the time this work 
begins for creative solutions networks of appropriate number, scale, velocity, 
and dexterity to evolve to maturity. Consider: co- creating non-imperialistic, 
multi-cultural or domestic agendas for community of global scale aesthetic 
endeavors. Consider: the continuous re-invention of non-hierarchical telecom 
networks that will allow people to bypass cultural gatekeepers and power 
brokers. We must accept these kinds of challenges and recognize what can be 
gained by solving them. </p><p>
All of this implies that there is a new way to be in the world. That the 
counterforce to the scale of destruction is the scale of communication, and 
that our legacy or epitaph will be determined in many ways by our ability to 
creatively employ informal, multi-media, multi-cultural, conversational, 
telecommunications and information technologies.</p><p>

Artists' use of networks to create art blurs boundaries between art, and 
social and political work. It establishes a potential for the codeservation of 
distinct cultures and new hybrids. It offers the possibilities of public 
participation in the creation of new realities. The extent to which these 
visions are broadly realized depend on the economic, legal, social, and 
technical frameworks with which we construct our Information Infrastructure.</p><p>

<a href="makingArt.html#START"><img src="arrow.gif"></a><b><i>Michael Joyce</i></b><br>
<code>MIJOYCE@vaxsar.vassar.edu</code><p>

This message invites interested artists, writers and others concerned with 
network resources for the arts to participate in a new and codessing national 
effort to codeserve computing resources for the arts on the informational 
superhighway (or NII as it is termed by the Clinton administration). Since 
time is of the essence, please repost this message to interested parties 
nationally and internationally and try to understand and forgive multiple 
postings to you. </p><p>
   Through a simple twist of fate I was very recently invited to participate in 
an ad-hoc meeting in Washington, D.C regarding Arts and Humanities computing 
and the NII co-hosted by the (ARL, CAUSE and Educom sponsored) Coalition for 
Networked Information and the Getty Foundation. The meeting involved some 
twenty participants including codesidents or directors of a wide range of 
humanities organizations, information industry and publishing organizations 
as well as officials of NEA, NEH, and NSF. Meeting co-chair Charles Henry, 
Director of Vassar College Library, set the tone for the meeting by noting 
that "more space is devoted in the NII prospectus to discuss automating 
heating of federal buildings than to arts and humanities computing." </p><p>
   Like many of you receiving this posting, I had been under the imcodession that 
surely someone was speaking for our interests in the deliberations of the 
Clinton administration regarding NII. However in the discussion that followed 
it became quite clear that this was not so. A number of participants shared 
horrifying tales which made it clear that not only were humanities and arts 
interests not being heard but also that, as regards humanities and arts 
computing, entertainment industry forces (which Stuart Moulthrop has termed 
the "Military Infotainment Complex") were largely calling the shots. There 
was a wide-scodead feeling among participants that a crisis existed and that 
something had to be done. </p><p>
   As the lone electronic artist at the meeting I described my own participation 
by saying I felt like the unelected recodesentative of a nomadic tribe, a 
recodesentative of the many unrecodesentable (in both senses) artists, writers 
and others who depended upon the network as a place for performance, 
community, collaboration and publication. I suggested that many of us fancy 
ourselves as functioning at the interstices in temporary autonomous zones and 
yet nonetheless increasingly find that our own "cultural heritage" *is* the 
net itself. While our interests and those of traditional humanities 
organizations (such as university codesses or textual archive projects) might 
be at cross purposes, I suggested that we shared the concerns of those at the 
meeting seeking to codeserve and protect. "object information," textual 
databases, and digital libraries. My comments were received with respect and 
interest by a group which understood the need to form alliances with us but 
quite frankly wished to focus on what they perceived as the immediate crisis.</p><p>
   The meeting ended with a consensus on the need to define a rubric for 
humanities and the arts in NII; to collect data on computing in the humanities 
and the arts to support congressional lobbying; and to form alliances with 
identified stake-holders in these efforts. A codeliminary crisis statement 
drafted by a steering committee will be codesented to congress and the 
administration.and widely publicized. </p><p>
     What prompts this message.is an invitation to review and perhaps join in the 
signing of this statement when it is circulated.in the coming week. Since to 
the best of my knowledge no coordinating group of network artists and writers 
exists, I am asking interested persons and organizations to email me directly 
(<code>MIJOYCE@vassar.edu</code>).and I will circulate the statement for you to consider.</p><p> 
     If you decide to affiliate yourself or your organization with the statement, 
I will gather the (virtual) signatures and forward them to the steering 
committee. I do not myself intend to form an organization but will collect 
these signatures under a collective umbrella which I'm calling NAWOC 
(network artists, writers and others concerned). If any organization is 
already actively involved in such a project and would rather coordinate 
such an effort, I would be happy to forward all this information to them. 
(Likewise if there is a wider interest in forming such an organization, I'd 
be happy to join in those efforts.) </p><p>
    What's important is to act (at least for the moment) in concert.<br>

As public data networks unfold, the need for adapting cultural concerns and 
empowerment becomes more and more crucial to the very survival of the 
indigenous groups involved. There is the concern that public data networks 
will add to the dilution of "what is already appropriately Indian." I add 
there is already too much confusion out there as to what is "traditional" 
Indian, a term highly misused and poorly understood, at times by Indians 
themselves. Nevertheless, cultural policy that is adaptable to on-line 
etiquette, or laws that govern intellectual and cultural property rights are 
key considerations when working with indigenous peoples. The concept of 
sovereignty must be intercodeted to include access to on-line public data 
networks. Tribal society whether its the clan, the village, the tiospaye, or 
whatever cultural unit standing must have a place to say who is a member of 
their people, and who is not!</p><p>

HALL OF WHISPERS takes its name from an ancient Babylonian myth of a specially 
constructed room in one of the ziggurats where a whisper would stay alive 
forever. I have an image of the electronic networks whispering ceaselessly 
with the voices of these times. The form of the project is deceptively simple: 
I wanted to create a situation where a group of people could share the 
experience of living, where we could join each other around a technological 
campfire, for the profoundly human act of storytelling. </p><p>
    The guidelines were very simple: participants were asked for two items. First 
was the text, whether story, observation, or poem. This was the "whisper". 
Second was the "theme". By theme, I meant a simple distillation of what this 
story/observation/poem meant to the participant. Each person chose their own 
theme for their text. Once it entered the HALL OF WHISPERS, other people could 
assign it other themes, or connect it with a story of their own, or one of the 
many stories already sent in from around the world. Meaning was no longer 
individual and sacrosanct, but communal. </p><p>
    Someone faxes in a story about the time they were followed by a horde of 
wasps when they spilled Hi-C tropical fruit punch on them- selves at a family 
picnic in Iowa. Someone else writes that every Friday night when they get off 
work, they get caught in the traffic of hundreds of high school kids cruising 
down the one street of their Alabama town. And someone else e-mails in that 
the week before Carnival in Rio, her family buys everything they'll need, as 
if they're codeparing for a hurricane; she says it's much like returning to 
primitive times. And all three stories are connected by a larger theme of 
<i>NATURAL DISASTERS</i>.</p><p>
    HALL OF WHISPERS has two stages. The first stage circulated stories between 
participants on the electronic networks via FAX, computer, and telephone. 
Several people also participated via standard mail. A large part of the 
project I didn't foresee in the beginning were the conversations in my own 
neighborhood. For people who had no experience, or interest, in using the net, 
but still had a wealth of life experience to share, I became a scribe. I would 
pass on the stories from the net, and they would tell me their own. It became 
a sharing of gifts, flowing across the arbitrary boundaries of virtual and 
physical communities.</p><p>
    The second stage of the project is still in formation. At this writing, I 
foresee the stories in digitized human voice, so it will literally begin to 
whisper. The same interconnections of the stories will still hold in a 
hyper-linked database, allowing visitors to follow their own thread of 
associations. For this, I'm looking at the possibility of CD-ROM distribution. 
This stage will be completed in the first part of 1993.</p><p>
    I was interested in several things at the outset of HALL OF WHISPERS. First, 
I wanted to create a virtual community using an ancient fundamental of 
community-making: shared stories. Second was creating a council model for 
understanding our world. Basically, the council model holds that it is in the 
sharing that greater wisdom evolves. Finally, in a turbulent world, it is easy 
to lose sight of the small beauties and moments of grace that occur constantly 
around us. I wanted HALL OF WHISPERS to give voice to that side of ourselves 
that recognizes that this is as much a time of renewal as it is a time of 
decay.</p><p>
    Has it succeeded? I can't say for sure; it's still very early in the life of 
the piece. But I talked to one of the participants the other day, and I asked 
her what happens for her. Here's what she told me: "First, I think I should 
write something. I should respond. But I don't. Not right away. Instead, I 
read the stories and I start thinking about things I haven't thought about 
in twenty years. I take my time because I'm looking for something. I don't 
know what, but I know it when I find it. I don't want to send back just any 
old story. It's too special.</p><p>

<b>MATRIX: WOMEN NETWORKING</b></p><p>
Matrix is an ancient word that has many meanings. The archaic meaning of 
matrix is womb. In "Neuromancer," William Gibson's book about cyberspace, 
matrix is used synonymously with computer network...a matrix can be seen as 
a nurturing, flexible, and creative environment where change and growth are 
possible within the web of the matrix itself.</p><p>
    Current technological challenges are the ability to seamlessly exchange 
images, video, and audio across platforms -- without requiring users to have 
specialty software to decode transmissions. This work has taken two tracks -- 
the high end requiring tremendous bandwidth and resources, and the low end 
focussing on currently available bandwidth, and working toward general 
availability. MATRIX: WOMEN NETWORKING will demonstrate low end 
developments... Our goal in focusing on the low end is to call attention 
to the technological disparities that exist in our society, and to raise 
questions about their impact. We hope to expand the concept of technological 
advances to include their social and cultural underpinnings and affects. </p><p>
    MATRIX features works by women of differing cultures and artistic backgrounds 
who are working with computer networks as a means of creating collaborative 
works with artists and non-artists alike, to decentralize the creative 
process, to educate about and codeserve their distinct cultures and 
communities, and to provide online access to population groups who would 
otherwise be the have-nots of the information age.</p><p>

In the text-based cyberspace created by electronic conferencing systems, 
cohesive stories can be written and read by the group mind. THIRTY MINUTES 
IN THE LATE AFTERNOON, a group-written narrative, was produced on Art Com 
ELectronic Network on the WELL in 1990. The backbone of the WELL is a 
conferencing structure in which users exchange information in "topics". In 
THIRTY MINUTES, Three separate characters were written simultaneously by 15 
writers in 3 parallel topics.</p><p>
    I set the story in the San Francisco Bay area during the 30 minutes codeceding 
the Loma Prieta Earthquake. John and Mary were codeparing (separately) for 
their first date. The third character was a street person known as Rubber Duck 
for his habit of constantly muttering the words "rubber duck". John was in his 
apartment shaving. Rubber Duck was sitting on the steps of the Museum of 
Modern Art. Mary's route involved a freeway and a bridge that would both break 
when the earthquake hit. I asked participants to choose a character, enter 
the topic and speak/think as that character. Since this was the group mind 
taking the persona of the characters, the emphasis was on the character's 
thoughts and memories.</p><p>
    In the final work, I put the 3 topics in a narrative data structure in which 
the thought streams of the 3 characters were simultaneously displayed in 3 
parallel columns. The writers included: Anna Couey, Abbe Don, Matisse Enzer, 
Carole Gould, Eleanor Kent, Tom Mandel, Gil MinaMora, Harold Poskanzer, 
Howard Rheingold, The Normals, Fred Truck, and Kathleen Watkins. Their 
unedited words formed a surprisingly seamless 7 page narrative in which the 
thoughts of men and women about each other were openly excodessed - 
interspersed with Rubber Duck's sometimes appropriate (and sometimes 
inappropriate) words, thoughts and memories.</p><p>

I have a very positive attitude about the potential of art via 
telecommunications since my experience of sharing my interactive installation 
DIGITAL MUDRA. Many who did not experience it in the San Francisco Bay Area 
at the KALA Institute and at St Mary's College in 1988-89 were able to 
participate in an essential phase of the work on ACEN on the WELL.</p><p>
    DIGITAL MUDRA was originally an interactive installation where viewers became 
acquainted with cross-cultural correlations of hand gestures and their 
trans-cultural meanings by both seeing and doing. Slides of political figures 
gesticulating; portrait gesture assemblages on the wall; and a videotape of 
Mudra dances codepared the viewers to become a participants. As participants 
they composed phrases from selected Mudra gestures that when entered into the 
computer became an animated gesture dance on the screen. The gestures were 
then transformed back into their original word meanings which, when selected, 
triggered relevant philosophic guidelines from a data base of epigrams by the

    The telecommunication piece offered the Mudra word list from which two 
selected words were to be used in a phrase about the "sweet mystery of life". 
The key word choice that helped unlock this mystery and the query of whether 
the other word "sweetened the mystery" generated the Tagore epigram. The sweet

<b>BROWN HOUSE KITCHEN</b></p><p>

It's the year 2000 in the East Bay. Most people no longer live in 
space-wasting fully furbished houses or apartments. Instead, they sleep in 
small spaces and eat in communal kitchens like Brown House Kitchen: </p><p>

</p><pre>&gt;An Early Ubicomp Era kitchen. Early Morning. The sun, coming through white 
lace curtains that look out on a small irregularly watered yard, falls 
invitingly on a round oak table, surrounded by six chairs. In the NorthEast 
corner, an old man sits in a blue green rocking chair, reading a newspaper. 
He looks like your grandfather. 

&gt;What appears to be a sculpture of a kitchen drawer is mounted on a pedestal 
in the NorthWest corner. In the Southwest corner, there is a kitchen sink, 
decorated with blue tiles. An orange cat stands on the edge of the sink, 
drinking water from a slow faucet drip. Beside the sink, sits incongruously, 
a shiny black metal box with a translucent crystal handle. The word BARBIE-Q 
is printed across the front of the box in pink sequin-studded letters.

&gt;You see Sandy's Drawer, Ralph Will Clean Up After You, GoodFood, Narranoter, 
telephone, and Barbie-Q here. </pre><br><p>

As part of my 1994 residency at Xerox PARC, I'm working with Pavel Curtis 
in Computer Science Laboratory -- writing and programming a narrative in 
<a href="telnet://guest@lambda.parc.xerox.com:8888" class="broken">LambdaMoo </a>
(an object-oriented Multi User Dungeon) The narrative, called 
BROWN HOUSE KITCHEN, is disclosed by the objects in a room of that name in 
LambdaMoo.</p><p>
    Readers (called players in this environment) will enter the story when they 
enter the room, and, the story will unfold as they discover and examine the 
output and input devices that are contained in objects in the kitchen.</p><p>
    The work exists in virtual time and space and will not only challenge readers 
to discover and unwrap streams of text but will also locate readers within the 
story and eventually give them the opportunity to enrich the environment that 
comprises the narrative. </p><p>
    The story, a murder mystery, is meant to appeal to the usual players in 
LambdaMoo while at the same time stretching the possibilities of the form. 
A murder took place in the kitchen, but players may not know that when they 
come into Brown House. Who died? Who was responsible? </p><p>
    The computing devices that operate the kitchen have observed events in various 
ways. In Rashoman fashion they relate the details of the things that occurred 
in November 2000 in different, sometimes contradictory ways.</p><p>

<a href="makingArt.html#START"><img src="arrow.gif"></a><b><i>Tim Perkis</i></b><br>

Much of the emphasis on current computer technology has been on building 
powerful "one-man-band" systems, which allow one composer/musician, working 
alone, to create and realize works on synthetic orchestras of any description. 
These programs propose a vision of music as a process of creating perfect 
"sound-objects, polished and perfected. No troublesome musicians are needed, 
no strings to break, reeds to squeak, or drummers to show up late and drunk. 
But music is in its essence a social process, and I have wanted to find a way 
to use the new musical resources offered by computer technology to excodess and 
reinforce this fact. </p><p>
    As a consequence, in 1986 fellow composer John Bischoff and I began a group 
called "The Hub". a computer network band. The idea was to find a way for 
composers working in the computer controlled electronic music medium to play 
together. Each composer has a computer controlled synthesizer system which is 
connected to the others on a local area network system of our own design. 
Composers designing pieces for this band generally only specify the data which 
is to be shared between players on the net. The result is a sort of enhanced 
musical improvisation, when the computers and players are all continually 
making musical decisions based upon what the others are doing.</p><p> 
    The nature of the collaboration between Hub composers is unusual. There are 
many meetings where data exchange formats are ironed out. Composers then go 
home, write some code, come together and try it out, and make adjustments. 
Often group discussions take place over e-mail. At performance time, the 
computers are making most of the note-to-note decisions, and the 
composer/performers are left to make global adjustments. The result is a 
really new kind of collective composition, a new social way of making music 
that didn't exist before. We have a good time.</p><p>

Since I started on-line communication, I've neglected my diary. I ask myself: 
Will telecom supplant diary as my daily practice? My grandmother kept a diary 
for sixty years. Will a diskette be my legacy? Perhaps my descendants will 
discover me not in my private mediation, but in communal discourse.</p><p>
    I always feel guilty when I upload a poem. A poem lives through its form. It 
feels wrong to force a poem through a wire - scatter it to bits - and 
reassemble it in a place where there is no paper or breath. There is no 
surface for the poem to rest on. Does it get vertigo? </p><p>
    Yet I think my poems are willing to suffer the journey if they get to be seen 
and read.</p><p>

I think the major concerns are limitations and imposed boundaries, including 
the extent to which the evolution of networking activity is constrained by 
its formulation in terms of systems that are approaching obsolescence.</p><p>
    The impact of network imcodessions may not translate into the traditional 
domain of commodity display in a coherent or analogous manner. A distortion 
or muting of intent and imcodession are more likely the result, what was 
transmitted or shared becomes invested with code-conceived expectations, or 
structured in hierarchical ways to serve completely separate purposes. Then 
the echo has no reference to its source.</p><p>
    Shifting and dissolving boundaries of mind, and of time and space open higher 
dimensionalities of possibility. The virtual realities of networking and 
conception make what was once fantastic or ambitious in scope become more 
probable, approachable, given that the shared resources of the global energy 
of minds is accessible and transmutable. The merger of collective imaginations 
in a collaborative endeavor is an entity perhaps beyond the comcodehension of 
any single participating mind, which may yield societal organisms, communal 
thoughts, and consciousness of great potential and resonance. The power of 
converging minds amplifies in the open system contexts of networking. </p><p>
    This mind fusion community and awareness is beneficial to the planet and 
humanity. Closure is a fate we can't afford given that the times are about 
survival and require vision emanating from beyond the given constructs of 
any socio-political-economical status quo. </p><p>
    Embarking on a Janusian voyage is not a vacillation, it is referential, and 
the past is a staging area for thrusts or migrations into the future. We are 
in a period of experimentation and exploration, glimpsing horizons, and 
creating conditions for enduring co-existence with the universe."</p><p>

I recently read a book THE LAST REEL* which is about the early pioneers in 
the development of the movie camera and the movie projector. </p><p>
    This is in the days when gelatin and plastic substrates were not yet invented, 
when they actually strung together glass plates to try and project a moving 
image. The artists and inventors working then had a passionate belief that 
film would become a revolutionary medium - and for years and decades these 
inventions were developed in the back rooms of inventors homes.</p><p>
    At this time there was no knowledge of what the right format would be - 
whether film would be shown in booths in fair arcades, in theaters, or even 
in the large "panorama" facilities where large painted scenes were scrolled 
by a walking audience.</p><p>
    Artists working today in art and telecommunications are in a position of these 
early pioneers in film technology. The vision of what could be, but the 
technology is not yet a "plastic" medium under the control of the artist.</p><p>
    Artists have been struggling with text based media, with slow scan 
transmission, with facsimile. The limitations of the technology are 
frustrating. The ultimate multi-media telecommunications medium is probably 
decades away - and even ISDN and all the other near term solutions are not 
really here yet.</p><p>
    At the same time the artists working together are establishing the theoretical 
base for all the issues that will eventually become crucial in these art forms 
of the future. In many ways the Constructivist artists worked out many of the 
issues of computer art, before the computer was available. For the reasons of 
technical limitations, the most powerful use of telecommunications systems 
today is often the simplest and the most thoughtful at a conceptual level. </p><p>
    Artists interested in the perspective of the early days of film technology, 
are referred to the book THE LAST REEL for some thought provoking comparisons.<br>

In the case of USENET and all of its variations, the Defense Department and 
many university computer science departments pay for that node's long distance 
services.</p><p>
   In the case of commercial suppliers, such as MCI Mail, Compuserve, the WELL, 
and GENIE, major corporations are owners. I.P. Sharp has donated space to 
artists for use in messaging and art projects. </p><p>

Problems perceived:</p><p>

1) Will the Defense Dept. always want to subsidize on-line art projects? 
USENET is supposed to be limited to defense oriented projects. There have 
been many changes in nodes in USENET in the last few years, with several 
universities (University of Wisconsin, for one) dropping out of the net due 
to financial difficulties. </p><p>

2) Art projects 
involving multiple authorship are generally not done on commercial nets, with 
the WELL and I.P. Sharp being notable exceptions. If the business climate 
goes sour, it is possible that favorable conditions for artists on those 
machines will be restricted. </p><p>

Conclusion: In most commercial systems, the artists pay something as it stands 
now. These same systems offer gateways to USENET, and the rest of the world. 
If the artist is located in a university situation, access is often free (or 
paid for by his or her dept). None of these situations are owned or operated 
by artists. All are vulnerable to economic or institutional control, thus 
reminding one of the current NEA mess concerning grants for the Robert 
Mapplethorpe photography show and raising the spectre of censorship.</p><p>

I see a paradox here- we have a communication medium that is truly global- 
that allows artists to be in instant contact with each other, but in sending 
things out we clearly have a total mismatch of the context - information about 
local issues and concerns may either find an echo elsewhere, or else this 
information may be incomcodehensible.</p><p>
    If information sent out does not connect with sufficient local context 
connections, then this information is either incomcodehensible to the receiver 
or misunderstood. Because electronic media allow us to communicate with people 
while being totally ignorant of the context of the receiver, then there is a 
real danger of the communication being a very violent and blunt instrument </p><p>
    Its always surprised me how many people want to receive Fineart Forum, but 
what a small percentage of these people ever send us email either for us to 
include their submissions, or else to comment on what they see. The electronic 
media should be democratic and non-centralized by their nature- yet so easily 
it becomes a mere broadcasting medium not an interactive medium. </p><p>

</p><pre>&gt;In the case of USENET and all of its variations, the Defense Department

&gt;distance services.</pre><br><p>

Excuse me? The Defense Department?</p><p>

You seem to be confusing USENET (which is an anarchic cooperative network 
with no centralized authority) with the Internet (parts of which are supported 
by various government agencies, but most by assorted companies, universities, 
and other organizations) with the ARPANET (which doesn't exist any more, but 
used to be supported by the Department of Defense).</p><p>

&gt;
&gt;1) Will the Defense Dept. always want to subsidize on-line art

would not be by the U.S. Department of Defense. </p><p>

GEnie has no gateways to anywhere, as far as I know. CompuServe has no

You've got a good point, but the background is very confused. What you seem to 
want to talk about is *government* sponsorship, or, rather, setting of access 
policies, for networks. The most relevant government agency these days is NSF, 
the National Science Foundation, for the NSFNET backbone and for the proposed 
NREN (National Research and Education Network). And, to a lesser extent, local 
governmental sponsorship, as for universities.</p><p>

is why I wrote "Which Network, and Why It Matters" in our newsletter, Matrix

    What you don't talk about in your article is the issue of who owns not the 
nets but the *words*. I don't know if this has ever been litigated, but at 
one time CompuServe was asserting a kind of "collective copyright" meaning 
that they would go after someone attempting to gateway an *entire* CompuServe 
forum. That's a codetty big strike against CompuServe as an art locus.</p><p>
    By contrast, the WELL appears positively enlightened. It tells me the moment 
I log in that *I* own my words. Sounds perfect as an art locus, right? Well, 
wait a minute. If I own my words, that means no one can reproduce them (read 
gateway ...) without my permission. I feel *VERY STRONGLY* that telcom based 
art must be gatewayed to as many networks as possible, codeferably 
automatically. For a WELL conference to be gatewayed, it would require a kind 
of "implied consent" that the poster to a conference gives permission for her 
or his words to be gatewayed to wherever.</p><p>
    Now there is codecedent for this. I'm thinking of the Venice Biennale feed.* 
Back then we were all so thrilled to have the opportunity to be 
telecommunicated to Venice that no one picked nits. But frankly, automatic 
gatewaying of a conference on the WELL *does* violate the letter of the law 
of WELL policy; this is an issue that's got to be decided by the WELL 
community itself. (It's possible this has been discussed already; I haven't 
been very active on the WELL for a long time.)</p><p>
    On the other hand, USENET is in fact perfect as an origin net for gatewaying 
to other nets. It is already international, which CompuServe and the WELL and 
Prodigy are not. Automatic gatewaying to other networks is no different than 
the store-and-forward propagation that happens already internal to USENET.</p><p>

Technology and telecommunication provides a new medium to explore. This

to such an extreme, as is available in cyberspace. Not even close. What does

(<a href="telnet://guest@lambda.parc.xerox.com:8888" class="broken">LAMBDAMOO</a> OCTOBER 4, 1993) </p><p>

</p><pre>open door

&gt;You open the closet door and leave the darkness for the living room, 
closing the door behind you so as not to wake the sleeping people 
inside.

&gt;The Living Room
&gt;It is very bright, open, and airy here, with large plate-glass windows 
looking southward over the pool to the gardens beyond. On the north wall, 
there is a rough stonework fireplace. The east and west walls are almost 
completely covered with large, well-stocked bookcases. An exit in the 
northwest corner leads to the kitchen and, in a more northerly direction, 
to the entrance hall. The door into the coat closet is at the north end of 
the east wall, and at the south end is a sliding glass door leading out onto 
a wooden deck. There are two sets of couches, one clustered around the 
fireplace and one with a view out the windows. You see Cockatoo, README for 
New MOOers, a fireplace, a newspaper, Welcome Poster, LambdaMOO Takes A New 
Direction, The Daily Whale, The Carpet, The Birthday Machine, Helpful Person 
Finder, lag meter, Noodles, Lanfear, Mustang Sally, GUARD, Banshee, Timbre, 
and shadow here. Soulglue (distracted), Leigh-Cheri, john, Wocha (confused), 
evangeline, Valere, Trystan, KarlT, CyberTec, Zeebo (worn out) (bored), gekko 
(Disconnected), Dr.Fate, Gus (distracted), legba, and Uther_Pendragon are 
here.

"1. It's lonely out there. I'm tired of the mindless saps who populate 
most systems. More artists; More fun.</p><p>

2. Beware the state. I'm a real believer in reaching for the Touffler ideal, 
and I fear the perversion of a government increasingly dependent upon 
computers and telecomm without public participation. Individual empowerment 
is #1.</p><p>

3. Cyberspace is cool. It is both a production, distribution, and exhibition 
space all rolled into one. *Media* people may still slobber over video, but 
telecomm is the NeXT wave. I just want to be involved before the NEA creates 
funding categories for it, and the arts institutions co-op it all.</p><p>

4. Telecomm is liberating. Freed of time, space, age, race, and gender, people 
are able to create new organic relationships. Here is the new age paradigm 
shift. Lets breaking boundaries and building new bridges.</p><p>

5. Beware the corporation. Prodigy. Need I say more? </p><p>

6. Information wants to be free; The cry of the cyberpunk. If we actually 
shared our resources, the world would be a happier place. Telecomm gives us 
an infrastructure to make this possible -- if we want.</p><p>

7. Computers are cool. I still can't program, but I still am able to wrap my 
hands around the world through my terminal screen. Better than free frequent 
flyer miles.</p><p>

8. A community within teleCOMMUNICATIONS. Its a big bad post-modern world 
out there. People need a support system to survive. Find it through a church, 
a gang, a local coffeehouse -- or through an online net.</p><p>

9. Why look back? You can't control the past or the codesent, but you can 
chart a future trajectory. And telecomm is THE future. </p><p>

10. Make big bonzo bucks! Yeah, right ;-)"</p><p>

"The network will allow for the active use of telecommunications for language

   A sequence of exchanges will provide for the exercise of fluxes and refluxes,

   As structured yet intermittent connection, REFLUX is intended to create a 
micro-process of cultural propagation, mirroring the analogous process of 
cultural diffusion and change which occurs in large scale.</p><p> 
   The interactive process must entail a cultural responsiveness, a confrontation 
of codes and attitudes, a flowing of non-compulsory interactivity.</p><p>

The Telluride InfoZone is a pilot project for broad spectrum community 
development and education in rural areas, using information and 
telecommunications technologies. It is being planned as a pragmatic answer 
to real issues facing this place, and as a test-bed for systems, services, 
and the long range social, economic and cultural implications of 
"telecommunities" in our "information society"........... As government and 
corporate interests form alliances and position themselves to create a new 
National Information Infrastructure, there is a growing movement among 
regional and local communities and dedicated individuals to shape a more 
humane, socially serving direction for our tele-media-ted future. Participate 
in this vital conversation and help promote an ecology of the information 
environment.......... </p><p>

<code>JESSE@EARLHAM.BITNET</code><p>

I'm currently reading an incredible book called <i>The Farther Shore: A Natural 
History of Perception</i>, by Don Gifford. The (I believe) fourth chapter, which 
I just completed, has sent my brain into hysterical overload.</p><p>
    In it, he describes the changes in our perception effected by the development 
of statistical science. Humankind remade in the image of Everyman/Average 
Man/Probability Man. Decodessing? I was reminded of the poem in John Brunner's 
dystopian near-future novel *Stand on Zanzibar*, entitled "Citizen Bacillus", 
a devastating implication of the society that reduces human beings to 
interchangeable units, numbers in a database... bacteria, subhuman.</p><p>
    But more to the point, Gifford talks about the sheer quantity of artistic 
"product" being produced daily, annually. There are 96,000 people who 
register as visual artists on the census of New York City. He speculates on 
how many truly great poets are going to be lost forever in a sea of 
mediocrity. What an appalling vision... </p><p>
    As I thought about this, I wondered if it is not time to resubmerge the 
creative mind into the group effort, like those medieval monks who 
anonymously created all those intricate, painstakingly-made texts in utter 
anonymity.</p><p>
    Is that possible, or desirable? Is willing and intentional obscurity the 
only alternative to forcible obscurity in the "confetti of numbers"? Would 
the tide be even slightly stemmed if the world's artists all pooled their 
efforts instead of individually producing their own ego-invested works?</p><p>

<b>HIPITCHED VOICES</b></p><p>

What began as an idea to provide, with the HiPitched Voices project, a 
resource for women interested in writing collaborative hypertexts, has turned 
into a much larger concept with a far greater potential for strengthening the 
codesence of women in computer technology. While the original proposal to 
gather a range of hypertexts into a deeply multiple web can and may still be 
developed, the diversity of ideas which have been suggested since the Voices 
email list was established just two months ago extends our platform to what 
might now be called a collective of women using technology to work 
collaboratively within hypertextual concepts.</p><p>

Some of our current plans include:</p><p>

- <i>the establishment of an ftp archive site</i> (that is, online and available 
through the Internet), titled VOX, at Washington University in St. Louis. </p><p>

Initially, two ideas will be implemented for this space. First, a hypertextual 
literary anthology called "the Making" which will be designed somewhat in the 
manner of a MUSE (Multi-User Simulation Environment) as an online "place" that 
anyone can visit, adding their own contributions to the collection. Second, a 
workshop or commentary location for works-in-progress.</p><p>

This last will also be used as a kind of "central basket" for works of any 
kind placed there by each participant in HiPitched Voices. The basket, 
conceptually part of the originating prospectus, will be used as a means to 
help find partners for writing, multimedia, graphics, or other projects, and 
perhaps as a scene of ongoing rounds of "readings" (or changes) by anyone 
within Voices.</p><p>

- <i>the creation of a performance art work</i> on the subject of women in technology 
which would "travel" various email lists. </p><p>

- <i>plans for virtual meetings in a MOO</i> (similar to a MUSE) room called the 
Backwards Studio, which was created by one of the Voices participants. Our 
first meeting was held on Monday, Dec. 6. We will probably continue regular 
virtual meetings of this sort in the future, perhaps in different virtual 
locations.</p><p>

-<i> a Storyspace project</i>, mostly fictional with a poetry emphasis, but to 
include interspersed critical notation. The originator of this potential 
collaboration is also interested in seeing an eventual translation of the 
project to a MOO space.</p><p>

"....This social contract requires one to give something, and enables one to 
receive something. I have to keep my friends in mind and send them pointers 
instead of throwing my informational discards into the virtual scrap-heap. It 
doesn't take a great deal of energy to do that, since I have to sift that 
information anyway in order to find the knowledge I seek for my own purposes. 
And with twenty other people who have an eye out for my interests while they 
explore sectors of the information space that I normally wouldn't frequent, I 
find that the help I receive far outweighs the energy I expend helping others: 
A perfect fit of altruism and self-interest. For example, I was invited to 
join a panel of experts who advise the U.S. Congress Office of Technology 
Assessment (OTA). The subject of the assessment is "Communication Systems 
for an Information Age." Before I went to Washington for my first panel 
meeting, I opened a conference in the Well and invited assorted 
information-freaks, technophiles, and communication experts to help me come 
up with something to say.</p><p>
     By the time I sat down with the captains of industry, government advisers, 
and academic experts at the panel table, I had over 200 pages of expert 
advice from my own panel. I wouldn't have been able to garner that much 
knowledge of my subject in an entire academic or industrial career, and it 
took me (and my virtual community) six weeks. The same strategy can be 
applied to an infinite domain of problem areas, from literary criticism to 
software evaluation."</p><p>
