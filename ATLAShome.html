<h1>ATLAS</h1>

<h2>Arts and Technology Resource and Reference</h2>
<h3>An information map of ideas, tools, organisations, people and sources...</h3>
<hr>

ATLAS exists to provide information
resources to help bridge the information gap between artists and technologists in
the wide-ranging area of creativity in new media. As a result, the material contained here
covers a wide spectrum, from interface design to analysis of the social issues of
technology, presented in a variety of formats.<p>

The goal of ATLAS is to assemble the best information available on a particular
subject, filter it for interest and relevance levels, and present it with informative 
and clearly designed indexes. This will simplify access for the beginner, and save time
for the more expert by providing a high-level signal-to-noise ratio to avoid an
overflow of data.</p><p>

Note: Each document in ATLAS is described in detail on an index page and the indexes are hypertextually 
cross-connected, so a file may appear on more than one index page if it is relevant to 
more than one subject area. As well, the size of each file in ATLAS is given in 
kilobytes (k) next to its highlighted link. Highlighted links that do NOT have a size 
listed next to them are linked to other ATLAS index pages.</p><p>

</p><h3><a href="anima/ATLAS/ArtistNetResIndex.html" class="broken">Artist Networking Resources</a></h3> 
This section is a
compilation of various documents relating to internet-based information, including
brief histories of the net's development and available online resources related to
artistic endeavours.<p>

</p><h3>Conferences</h3>
 Several hundred conferences are staged every year relating to aspects 
of technology. Several dozen of them are relevant to the conjunction of art, technology 
and telecommunications.  This section, which is still under development, is intended to 
present documents relating to the most noteworthy of these. Sometimes there may be several 
individual texts associated with a single conference, such as the original Call For Participation
(or CFP), often released up to a year in advance, detailed Agendas, abstracts of
papers and presentations, and sometimes even reviews of the event. The sample documents
located here are divided by year, with selections available for <a href="anima/ATLAS/Conferences93Index.html" class="broken"><b>1993</b></a> 
and <a href="anima/ATLAS/Conferences94Index.html" class="broken"><b>1994</b></a><p>

</p><h3><a href="anima/ATLAS/Electronic_LitIndex.html" class="broken">Electronic Literature</a></h3>
What happens when the
ancient medium of writing encounters the modern electronic media? Some
explorations of the possibilities (including strategies for hypertext) and 
instructional materials can be found here.<p>

</p><h3><a href="anima/ATLAS/InterfaceIndex.html" class="broken">Interface</a></h3>
Interfaces are the means by
which human beings interact with computers, essentially the look and feel of
onscreen information presentation. Some interfaces are a joy to use, clear,
intuitive and natural. Others, well, they're the opposite, awkward, maddening and
ineffectual.<p>

</p><h3><a href="anima/ATLAS/SocialIssuesIndex.html" class="broken">Social Issues of Technology</a></h3>
What kinds of societies are created by telecommunications? How and why do these virtual
societies form, and what are their advantages and disadvantages as communities?<p>

</p><h3><a href="anima/ATLAS/TechToolsIndex.html" class="broken">Technological Tools for Art</a></h3> 
 This section
is designed to provide background information on the formats, standards and
devices of technology that are used for artistic expression. While some hint files
and network sources may fall into this category, its primary goal is to provide
detailed technical information.<p>

</p><h3><a href="anima/ATLAS/Technology_and_the_Law/</index.html" class="broken">Technology and the Law</a></h3>
Things have changed since the time of Hammurabi. Laws that were once written in stone are now being
stretched or entirely rewritten to accomodate changes in society brought about by
technology and telecommunications, especially in the areas of copyright and
information as intellectual property. This section reflects those
changes through electronic texts of actual laws and documents that explore the issues involved.<p>

</p><h3><a href="anima/ATLAS/The_New_Media/index.html" class="broken">The New Media</a> </h3>
This is an area for
information, discussion and policy papers related to the age of convergence, the
new forms of media brought about by combining existing media and media delivery
systems in new ways.<p>
