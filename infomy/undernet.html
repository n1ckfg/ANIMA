<p>
As one of the sponsors of INFOMY, undernet.* (an international Vancouver based
company) is actively testing consumer reaction to the options available to them
as a result of new  developments in telecommunications.  Fibre optic technology
is changing the world as we know it, with more options such as video
conferencing, interactive programming and others, more possibilities for new
markets continue to present themselves.  
</p>
<p>

With a membership of over 2000 people and a growth rate of over 70% per month,
undernet.* has clearly proven a consumer interest in creating a new
entertainment format based on communication, using existing technology to tap
into a new consumer base. 
</p>
<p>

Bringing the world together is not a new idea, but now for the first time
international communication is accesible.  This is what undernet.* hopes to do
with INFOMY, by bringing BC together to talk to the world.
