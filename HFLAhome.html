</p><h2>Re-thinking the Book</h2>


The advent of hypertext provides an opportunity to re-think the relationship
between narrative and the physical form of the book itself. To see the book as
simply the vehicle, the neutral container of the writer's imaginative output, is
to overlook the enormous impact which the very idea of the book has had on
narrative from The Bible to the Postmodern Novel and even hypertext fiction
itself.<p>

Subjects of particular interest in this regard include: The Book, The Book of
Nature, The Bible, The End of the Book, Death of the Author, Writing, Readerly
and Writerly Texts, Closure, The Novel, Romance, Realism and the Realist Novel,
Modernism and the Modern Novel, Postmodernism and the Postmodern Novel, The
Mystic Writing Pad, The Literature of Exhaustion, The New Novel, Marshall
McLuhan and The Gutenberg Galaxy, Illumination and the Electronic Sign,
Hypertext, The Rhetoric of Hypertext, Writing Hypertext, Writing Space,
Archeological Fiction, and Connections Without Centre: Infinite Hypertext.</p><p>


</p><h2>Guide to Publications</h2>


The field of hypertext writing and criticism is growing rapidly. We have
included a small sample of the institutions, publications and journals which
have expressed an interest in this medium. Much of this information is available
by e-mail through the Internet, Inter-Access, and the WELL or from Eastgate
Systems.<p>

Topics of interest include ISAST, Postmodern Culture, Ejournal, Leonardo,
ARTCOM, Perforations, Hypertexture, Narrabase Press, TapRoot, SwiftCurrent,
Intertext, Computers and Texts, Computer Mediated Writing, The Centre for Text
and Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology, The Internet Companion, and
Writing on the Edge.</p><p>



</p><h2>Writing and Reading Electronic Hypertexts</h2>


The hypertext writing environment presents many challenges to creative authors
and adventurous readers. Topics of interest to those about to embark on the work
of authoring include Writing Hypertext, Structural Paradigms, Structural
Conventions, Visual Representation of Nodes, Hyperbook Authoring Tasks,
Typography, Copyright and Hypertext, The Programmer as Literary Artist, The
Geometry of Authoring in Storyspace, and Beginning and Ending a Hyperbook:
Possibilities for Authors.<p>

Readers may wish to consider Readers of Hypertext, Difficulties with Reading
Hypertext, Cognitive Overhead, Disorientation, and Missing Context Clues.</p><p>

Conceptual considerations include The Rhetoric of Hypertext, Decentring,
Contour, Landow and the Politics of Connection, Computer Pedagogy and
Composition, The Library of the Future: A New Electronic Canon and Connections
Without Centre: Infinite Hypertext.</p><p>

No discussion of reading and writing electronic texts would be complete without
mentioning the contributions of Vannever Bush, Douglas Engelbart, and Ted
Nelson.</p><p>



</p><h2>The Non-linear Tradition in Literature</h2>


While hypertext technology provides new and rich possibilities for reconceiving
the very shape and form of The Book, writers have long registered their
resistance to the strictures of closure and the novel. Many texts produced as
printed books anticipate the non-sequential narratives of hyperbooks and others
offer particularly instructive examples of how the very form of publication can
serve as a vehicle of artistic expression.<p>

Print works of interest include: Sterne's Tristram Shandy; Robbe-Grillet's In
The Labyrinth; Nabokov's Pale Fire; Cort 's Hopscotch; O'Brien's At Swim-Two
Birds; Ballard's Atrocity Exhibition; Calvino's The Castle of Crossed Destinies;
and Pavi_'s Dictionary of the Khazars and Landscape Painted With Tea.</p><p>

A wide and various range of hyperbooks has already been produced which greatly
extend the boundaries of The Book. From Michael Joyce's experiments with
narrative in the groundbreaking Afternoon, A Story to the mixed-media HyperCard
stack of Beyond Cyberpunk!, the short history of the electronic hypertext
already augurs for a bright future.</p><p>

Other electronic works of interest include: Willmot's Everglade; Moulthrop's
Dreamtime; Gess' Mahasukha Halo; FitzGerald's Yet Still More; Malloy's Its Name
Was Penelope, Wasting Time and Thirty Minutes in the Late Afternoon; Joyce's WOE
and Guyer &amp; Petry's Izme Pass.</p><p>


</p><h2>Software Environments</h2>


One of the main goals of this study is to evaluate the available hypertext
authoring systems, with the aim of providing recommendations to potential
authors. Given the number of programs which claim to have hypertext functions,
it is impossible to review every package. Instead, we have taken samples from
each structural paradigm and have focussed on systems that are both affordable
and easy to use for non-expert computer users. A full checklist of evaluation
criteria and our requirements are available nearby.<p>

We have evaluated commercially available software for three environments.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dd>HyperShell
</dd><dd>HyperPad
</dd><dd>LinkWay
</dd><dd>DOS HyperWriter!
</dd><dd>HyperTies
</dd><dd>Folio
</dd><dd>VIEWS
</dd><dd>Dart
</dd><dd>Orpheus
</dd><dd>Windows Help Compiler

</dd><dd>SmarText 
</dd><dd>Knowledge Pro 
</dd><dd>FrameMaker
</dd><dd>Guide
</dd><dd>Apple HyperCard
</dd><dd>Storyspace PLUS
</dd></dl>
<p>
In addition, we have included evaluations of a number of important research
systems. An understanding of their features provides an important historical
perspective on the field.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dd>KMS InterMedia 
</dd><dd>NoteCards 
</dd><dd>IBIS 
</dd><dd>Xanadu 
</dd><dd>Memex
</dd></dl>
<p>
Our evaluations are based on product literature, published reviews, demos,
working copies, and full copies of the software. Thus, we have not had equal
access to information on all of the systems. Contact
addresses have been provided so you can obtain up-to-date pricing and
configuration information.</p><p>


</p><h2>Hypertext Terminology </h2>


This section contains a number of definitions which establish the terminology
used throughout this study. You may wish to acquaint yourself with the
definitions now, or come back to them as needed. We have provided links in other
parts of this study where most fundamental terms are used.

Although this study concerns itself with fictional hypertexts, the definitions
will be as general as possible in order to increase their utility. Those nodes
discussing specific works or hypertext packages will focus more intently on
fiction as a particular application.<p>

To begin with, you may wish to contrast the terms: hypertext and hyperbook</p><p>
