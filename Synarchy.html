</p><h2>Synarchy = GroupWare </h2>
<p>
Synarchy, or synchronous, synthetic anarchy, involves individuals linked 
technologically, socially, collaboratively, and professionally in organic spontaneous
relationship webs instead of in rote linearly defined or institutionally directed roles.  
</p><p>
Synarchy is an non-organizational non-structure (network) based on the principles
of a responsible, synchronous, creative, caring, coordinated anarchistic and artistic involvement.
</p><p>
Making this anti-system possible is computer assisted community networking facilitating 
intercommunications within the nomadic virtual tribe. 
</p><p>
Not a collectivist or industrial model cooperative, there are no meetings, no dues, 
no qualifications except the self-declaration of participatory engagement. I network
therefore I am.
</p><p>
This 'social' software is designed to weave ideas into the shared communications system, 
evolve those ideas into projects, to enhance the ideas and energy of those involved in the 
digital tribe programming ourselves to realize our ideas, dreams and projects using 
the common skills, experience and resources of those in the web.
