<h3>Operation and Design Principles</h3>

In the design of this site, we have attempted to strike a balance between
visually appealing graphic content and low-bandwidth speed. We encourage the
reader to keep on inline graphics loading to fully appreciate this site. We
provide information about the size of the graphics you are downloading beside
the image itself if it is more than 20k in size, otherwise the size of each
graphic and the total for the page is listed at the very bottom of each page.
<p>

And in an effort to make this site easily navigable, we have attempted to
provide links that take you "up" to relevant higher-level documents. Where
possible, these links will be found in the series of heads and subheads at the
top of each page.</p><p>

Further, the upper-leftmost icon on every page will take you to the ANIMA home
page, and the icon immediately next to it will take you to the top page of a
given section.</p><p>

</p><h3>Compass: How to get around this WebNode</h3>

At the bottom of each page you will find the Compass menu.
It is designed to help you find your way around ANIMA, it includes features such as
a link to <a href="ANIMAhome.html">Home</a>, the <a href="WhatsNew.html">What's New</a> page which
will tell you about new features and additions to the site if you make return visits, it is the place to start.
The <a href="Findex.html">Findex</a> or Fast Find Index provides an overview using a
hierachical list of the node logically arranged by section. 
The <a href="NODEMap.html">NodeMap</a>, while currently still under
development, will eventually provide a graphic means to conceptual exploration of this web. 
<a href="aboutSite.html">AboutNode</a> gives you some background information on the ANIMA site and 
<a href="WebWeavers.html">The WebWeavers </a> page tells you about the people who put this 
site together.

<hr>

Navigation in this site is as with all WWW servers; indicated links can be
selected and followed to relevant destinations. If you are using <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/MacMosaic/MacMosaicHome.html">NCSA
Mosaic</a>, links are indicated in color, usually blue.<p>

Further, we have designed an iconic interface system to help you recognize
specific parts of this node. These are best learned by exploring. 

At the bottom of each page we have collected a few of the relevant points of
departure, usually leading up the hierarchy toward more general information.</p><p>

Remember that as with any WorldWide Web node, any link could potentially lead
you elsewhere on the planet! We have tried for a consistent design to indicate
that a page is indeed part of our structure.</p><p>
