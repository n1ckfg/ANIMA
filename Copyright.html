<h2>Copyright Information</h2>

<hr>

Literary and artistic expressions here which are copyright or otherwise
protected or limited in their reproduction or distribution or so noted clearly
at the bottom of each page of the respective material. Please extend the
courtesy of respecting the rights and wishes of the creators of said
material.<p> and of course, on the other hand, John Oswald has said: "If
imagination is the field, copyright is the fences."</p><p>

</p><p>
The following alternative scheme is offered as a step towards
the evolution of more appropriate solutions.</p><p>

<b>IdeaRights</b> Copyright is too inflexible a concept to allow for the open promotion
of new ideas. We propose new models of authorship acknowledgement and idea
protection that open up rather than restrict the potential for more involvement
in ideas.  Patents are expensive, can be stolen, take too long to get, and are
often not an effective way to get new ideas protected.  The IdeaRights scheme
addresses specific issues regarding intellectual property rights, the exchange
and promotion of new ideas, and issues that have become major concerns in the
information age.</p><p>

<b>CopyRight</b> Ideas are the intellectual property of an author, at whose discretion
restrictions such as a licence fee or a royalty may be charged to those who
access or use that idea licence fee.</p><p>

<b>CopyNot</b> Private, secret or confidential ideas whose distribution is controlled
and restricted by the originator of that idea for personal, commercial or
developmental reasons.</p><p>

<b>PreCopy</b> Ideas identified as not ready for distribution yet and protected until a
defined stage of their development.</p><p>

<b>CopySynth</b> An open collaborative idea seeking refinement and development to which
people who contribute gain rights in proportion to their contribution, and thus
receive reward or credit.</p><p>

<b>CopyShare</b> Ideas which anybody can have access to, which are a public good, or
which users may use like shareware programs, they are ideas to which they can
contribute if they wish. Limits of distribution, credit or other recognition of the author 
is defined by the originator.</p><p>
